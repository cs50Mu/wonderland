    <h3>Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?</h3>
    <p>I grew up in Folsom, a suburb of Sacramento. My path to Cal was pretty typical - I did a few service clubs (including an after-school math program for elementary school students! :D), got good grades, and eventually applied. For the personal essay, I decided I hated writing about myself and instead wrote about inefficiency in global poverty interventions. For a long time, I had considered majoring in Cognitive Science or Neuroscience, but I'd say it was this near-fanatical obsession with effectiveness and efficiency that caused me to lean toward EECS. I knew I would find people who thought like me, and I knew I would make good things.

    <h3>How much programming have you done (and what languages)?</h3>

    <p>I admit I haven't done very much programming, especially not personal projects (something I hope to change next semester). I walked into Cal with about half an online course's worth of Python knowledge acquired the summer before. I know Python, Java, and Scheme, and a little bit of Javascript. I really like functional programming and am slowly working my way through Learn You a Haskell for Great Good.</p>

    
    
    <h3>What are your hobbies? What are some of your talents and skills?</h3>

    <p>I enjoy reading, writing fiction and verse, drawing, singing, playing board games, learning languages, translating movies and songs, and studying cognitive science.</p>

    
    <h3>Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?</h3>

    <p>This April my friends and I went to a Franz Ferdinand concert - it was my very first live concert (I know, I know), and it was great! I always wear the T-shirt everywhere.</p>
    
    <h3>What commitments will you be busy with this summer?</h3>

    <p>Besides TAing for 61A, I'm taking a class called The Mind and Language, planning a DeCal on effective altruism tentatively called "The Greater Good: Science, Reason, and Priorities in Making a Better World", planning a computer science summer camp, and hopefully writing a science fiction novella involving a lot of recursion.</p>

    <h3>How would you describe your teaching style?</h3>

    <p>That's a good question; I don't really know. I guess I always think of my students as my friends, and lean towards explaining things the way I would to a friend taking the course with me. I like my teaching to be heavily driven by questions from my students.</p>
