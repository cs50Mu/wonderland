    <h3>Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?</h3>
    <p>I was born in Phoenix, Arizona and I lived there pretty much until I came
    to Cal. I remember the weather hitting the 120's during the summers
    sometimes, so I'm definitely enjoying the weather here.
    </p>

    <p>I entered Cal as an Undeclared Engineer, and initially looked into the
    prospect of chemical engineering. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately) it
    didn't really suit me, so I explored other majors. I took CS 61A during the
    Summer of 2012, and I guess it was basically love at "Hello World".</p>

           
    <h3>How much programming have you done (and what languages)?</h3>

    <p>CS 61A was my first introduction to programming, so it's been two years
    now. I've mostly programmed in Python, although I'm fairly comfortable with
    Java, Scheme, MATLAB, and C, and somewhat proficient with Unix, HTML, CSS,
    and Javascript.
    </p>

    
    <h3>What are your hobbies? What are some of your talents and skills?</h3>

    <p>I enjoy running, although I don't dedicate as much time to it as I used to.
    I also developed a few amusing but useless skills when I was younger. Card
    throwing is the first thing that pops into my mind. </p>

    
    <h3>What commitments will you be busy with this summer?</h3>

    <p>I will be taking Stat 134 this summer as well.</p>

    <h3>How would you describe your teaching style?</h3>

    <p>I enjoy working with students at more individual levels. I also prefer to
    teach using examples rather than just talking. I consider myself as a
    kinesthetic learner (not moving, necessarily, but just through trying
    things out), so I think my teaching style tends to reflect that.</p>
