    <h3>Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?</h3>
    <p>Although I was born in America, my family moved to India when I
    was four years old.  I lived in Pune (which is near Mumbai) until
    four years ago, when I came to Berkeley.  I spent eight years at
    the same school until I graduated from 10th grade (which is a Big
    Deal in India), after which I studied in an IB (International
    Baccalaureate) program.
    </p>

    <p>Having grown up in India, I spent most of my free time playing
    outside with friends - in fact, I believe we didn't have TV for a
    few years after moving to India.  I certainly didn't use computers
    very often and even in ninth or tenth grade after using the
    Internet to do research, when it came to writing up a bibliography
    I would put down "www.google.com" and nothing else.  However, I
    did learn programming during those years - my school taught a
    small subset of C++ and Java.  (Almost all of what I learned in
    those years we will teach you in the first two lectures.  This is
    only a slight exaggeration.)
    </p>

    <p>Despite how little CS I learned from high school, it was still
    enough to pique my interest, and so I decided to apply for the CS
    major at all of my colleges.  I wanted to be in California (good
    universities, good weather, grandparents live in California) and
    so my top two picks were Berkeley and Stanford.  I didn't get into
    Stanford, so the decision was easy.
    </p>

    <p>In my first semester, I took CS 61A and loved it.  I knew at
    that point that I wanted to teach it as well.  Over the years, I
    have been a
    <a href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/coursesurveys/instructor/6969"
    target="_blank">TA</a> for CS 61AS, CS 61B (data structures), CS
    170 (algorithms), and CS 161 (security).  I graduated this past
    spring with a major in EECS and a minor in Physics, winning
    the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Students/Awards/#dept"
    target="_blank">Departmental Citation</a> (yes, a citation is
    actually a good thing here, it means I was the valedictorian in
    EECS) and
    becoming <a href="http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2014/05/12/university-medal-runners-up/"
    target="_blank">one of five finalists for the University
    Medal</a>.
    </p>

    <p>I have lab assisted for CS 61A every semester since I took it
    (for a total of 7 semesters now).  I have worked with Brian Harvey
    to design CS 61AS in its current form.  For the past two years, I
    have run the course along with Andrew.  This has given me a lot of
    experience that normally a TA wouldn't have - for example, I have
    personally written multiple discussions, quizzes, and final
    exams.  I have come up with administrative policies, written
    syllabi, written autograders, and calculated final course grades.
    In short, I have done almost all the tasks that an instructor
    would normally do, except for lecture itself.
    </p>

    <h3>How much programming have you done (and what languages)?</h3>

    <p>So a long time ago (perhaps during elementary school), I played
    around with the turtle graphics in Logo.  At the time, I didn't
    know I was programming.  In fact, it was only after coming to
    Berkeley and implementing a Logo interpreter in 61A that I
    realized that I had been programming the entire time.  Side note -
    Logo was actually created by Brian Harvey among others, who was my
    professor for 61A.  I actually went back and looked at my Logo CD,
    and his name was on it.
    </p>

    <p>Subsequently, I learned Basic, C++, and Java in high school, and
    promptly forgot both Basic and C++.  During the summer after 9th
    grade, I took part in a two-week program where I was taught SQL,
    C, HTML, VisualBasic, and a couple of others that I don't
    remember.  I don't know whose brilliant idea it was to take a
    bunch of ninth-graders with almost no programming experience and
    attempt to teach them five or six languages in two days each.
    </p>

    <p>Then of course I came to Berkeley and did tons of programming and
    learned many programming languages.  I think it's safe to say that
    I have many thousands of hours of programming experience, and over
    a thousand hours of teaching computer science experience.
    Probably over two thousand hours if you include the time I have
    spent on Piazza.  In order of familiarity, I've used the following
    languages:
    </p>

    <p>Languages that I could code in right now, perhaps with some Googling:
      <ul>
        <li>Lisp (specifically Scheme and Racket)</li>
        <li>Python 2</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Python 3</li>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>MIPS assembly</li>
        <li>Matlab</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Languages that I have coded in, but for which I would need a cheat sheet:
      <ul>
        <li>OCaml</li>
        <li>Forth (also ArrayForth/ColorForth, a dialect of Forth)</li>
        <li>Bash</li>
        <li>APL</li>
        <li>Ruby</li>
        <li>LabView</li>
        <li>Awk</li>
        <li>x86 assembly</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>What are your hobbies? What are some of your talents and skills?</h3>

    <p>I like to sing.  I'm told I'm a decent singer, but given all the
    other talented singers I've met at Berkeley, I have my doubts.</p>

    <p>I love logic puzzles, word games, and in general most games that
    exercise the brain.  I am particularly good at word games - I have
    played in the national junior Scrabble tournament in India,
    although I have no idea whether that compares to Scrabble in
    America.  I am also currently undefeated at Bananagrams.
    </p>

    <p>In India, we were never allowed to use a calculator, so I have
    become pretty good at mental arithmetic.  For example, I can
    multiply two digit numbers fairly quickly.  However, I'm more
    proud of my ability to estimate the answers to (almost) arbitrary
    numerical expressions (so it can involve sines, exponents, square
    roots, and so on).  Depending on how complex the expression is, I
    can usually get to around one or two significant figures.
    </p>

    <p>I enjoy many different sports, and I've played several off and on,
    with the result that I haven't become particularly good at any one
    of them.  (This is especially true since I haven't had any formal
    coaching in any sport.)  I especially like basketball and soccer
    (which should absolutely be called football, but oh well).
    </p>

    <p>I don't know if this counts as a talent/skill, but my arms are
    incredibly flexible.
    </p>

    <h3>Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?</h3>

    <p>I once built a nine story house of cards.  It took several hours
    of patience and carefully controlled movements.  It got so
    nerve-wracking near the end that it took a few tries before I
    could calm myself down enough to stop my hands from shaking as I
    put on the final touches.</p>

    <p>I have over ten thousand contributions on Piazza.  I wouldn't be
    surprised if I was the top contributor on all of Piazza.</p>

    <p>As for something memorable - a few years ago, I was guiding a
    group of campers in the Tadoba wildlife reserve in India, and a
    tiger walked right in front of us.</p>

    <h3>What commitments will be consuming your cycles this summer?</h3>

    <p>CS61A, CS61A, and - you guessed it - CS61A.</p>

    <h3>How would you describe your teaching style?</h3>

    <p>When I was a TA, I liked to have students work in groups, and then
    have each group present the answer to a specific problem.  This
    way I could actually get most of the students to participate
    during discussion.  It was rather unconventional - I talked *very*
    little during a discussion.  As a TA, students had the luxury of
    choosing which discussion they wanted to go to, so being
    unconventional was okay.  As a lecturer, I don't plan to do
    anything too unconventional.</p>
