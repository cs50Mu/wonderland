    <h3>Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?</h3>
    <p>I was born in Austin, TX, but moved to the Bay Area when I was two and have been living here since. The town I grew up in was (and still is) a very typical suburban environment, with friendly neighbors and a fair amount of open space, but not much excitement.
    </p>

    <p>I came to Cal unsure of what I would eventually want to major in. Throughout my life, I've always had a strong interest in math. Before coming to Cal however, I had very little experience with what computer science was. I had devoted a considerable amount of my high school life to business-related pursuits, and had seriously considered becoming a Business major at some point. I came into CS 61A with no clue what to expect, and left knowing that computer science was the right field of study for me.</p>

           
    <h3>How much programming have you done (and what languages)?</h3>

    <p>The programming languages that I feel most comfortable with are Python and Java. Although I had done some programming before coming to Cal, my first serious programming experience came when I took CS 61A during the Fall semester of my freshman year.</p>

    
    
    <h3>What are your hobbies? What are some of your talents and skills?</h3>

    <p>I really enjoy learning new things, especially if it's something particularly mind-blowing. It doesn't necessarily have to be computer-science related (although it often is), I just really enjoy knowing more about the world around me. I also really like to spend time just talking to people and getting to know them a little bit better.</p>

    <p>As far as tangible hobbies are concerned, I enjoy the occasional nap on Memorial Glade, especially on days when the sun is out but it isn't scorching hot. I also enjoy playing and listening to classical piano music, with Beethoven and Chopin being particular favorites of mine. When I have the free time, I also enjoy watching a good game of football/basketball and following various drama-y TV series (I'm currently trying to get caught up on White Collar and Suits).</p>


    <h3>Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?</h3>

    <p>Personally, I try to live life treating every moment as a memorable one, because you never know when something might happen that will change your life forever. I'd have to spend a little more time thinking about the first question - come talk to me sometime in office hours or otherwise and I'm sure I'll have an answer for you then! :)</p>
    
    <h3>What commitments will you be busy with this summer?</h3>

    <p>Helping make CS61A the best course possible! Besides that, I plan to do some exploring of Berkeley and the surrounding areas, as I feel like I don't know the area nearly as well as I should. If you have any recommendations for where I should go visit, please let me know!</p>

    <h3>How would you describe your teaching style?</h3>

    <p>I would describe my teaching style as being flexible, engaging, and interactive. I strongly believe that the best way of learning something is by doing it, and my classes will revolve around having students work together to solve and explain problems. I try to keep my own lecturing to a minimum, instead preferring to give students as much time as possible to actually implement what they've learned while I walk around providing useful tips and tricks. I also feel strongly that the classroom environment is about the students and not about me - I'm willing to modify lesson plans based off of what students want to learn and feel they struggle the most with. I want to make my labs and discussions something that students <strong><em>want</em></strong> to go to, not something that they <strong><em>have</em></strong> to go to. I've also been told that my teaching style (or maybe just my voice) makes people feel warm and safe, but opinions may vary on that one.</p>
