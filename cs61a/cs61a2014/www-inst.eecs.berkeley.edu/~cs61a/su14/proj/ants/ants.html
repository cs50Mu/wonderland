<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In this project, you will create a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tower_defense">tower
defense</a>
defense</a> game called Ants Vs. SomeBees.  As the ant queen, you
populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster.  Your ants
must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory.
Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be
vanquished.  Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your
queen will succumb to the bees' wrath.  This game is inspired by PopCap
Games' <a href="http://www.popcap.com/games/pvz/web">Plants Vs. Zombies</a> Â®.</p>

<p>This project combines functional and object-oriented programming
paradigms, focusing on the material from Chapter 2.5 of the lecture
notes.  The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing
a large program with many related parts.</p>

<p>This project includes several files, but all of your changes will be
made to the first one. You can download all of the project code as a
<a href="ants.zip">zip archive</a>.</p>

<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>

<p>This is a two-week project. You'll work in a team of two people, person
A and person B. In each part, you will do some of the work separately
and some together with your partner. For example, if a problem is
marked A1, then it is a solo problem for person A. Both partners should
read, think about, and understand the solution to all questions. Feel
free to help each other on the solo questions. If you choose to work on
the whole project alone, you must complete all questions yourself.
<strong>Note</strong>: only Person A should submit the project.</p>

<p>Start early!  The amount of time it takes to complete a project (or any
program) is unpredictable.  Ask for help early and often &mdash; the TAs and lab
assistants are here to help. You are not alone!</p>

<p>In the end, you and your partner will submit one project.
Person-specific problems are graded individually and do not affect your
partner's score.  There are 25 possible points for each person, 22 of
which  are assigned for correctness, and three points for the overall
composition of your program. There are also two points of extra credit
available at the end of the project, due with your submission.</p>

<p>The only file that you are required to submit is <code>ants.py</code>.  You do not
need to modify any other files to complete the project. To submit the
project, change to the directory where the files are located and run
<code>submit proj3</code>.</p>


<h2 id="core-concepts">Core Concepts</h2>

<p>A game of Ants Vs. SomeBees consists of a series of turns.  In each
turn, new bees may enter the ant colony.  Then, new ants are placed.
Finally, all insects (ants, then bees) take individual actions: bees
sting ants, and ants throw leaves at bees.  The game ends either when a
bee reaches the ant queen (you lose), or the entire bee flotilla has
been vanquished (you win).</p>

<p><strong>The Colony</strong>.  The colony consists of several places that are chained
together.  The <code>exit</code> of each <code>Place</code> leads to another <code>Place</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Placing Ants</strong>.  There are two constraints that limit ant production.
Placing an ant uses up some amount of the colony's food, a different
amount for each type of ant.  Also, only one ant can occupy each
<code>Place</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Bees</strong>.  When it is time to act, a bee either moves to the <code>exit</code> of
its current <code>Place</code> if no ant blocks its path, or stings an ant that
blocks its path.</p>

<p><strong>Ants</strong>.  Each type of ant takes a different action and requires a
different amount of food to place.  The two most basic ant types are
the <code>HarvesterAnt</code>, which adds one food to the colony during each turn,
and the <code>ThrowerAnt</code>, which throws a leaf at a bee each turn.</p>


<h2 id="the-code">The Code</h2>

<p>Most concepts in the game have a corresponding class that encapsulates
the logic for that concept.  For instance, a <code>Place</code> in the colony
holds insects and connects to other places.  A <code>Bee</code> stings ants and
advances through exits.</p>

<p>The game can be run in two modes: as a text-based game or using a
graphical user interface (GUI).  The game logic is the same in either
case, but the GUI enforces a turn time limit that makes playing the
game more exciting.  The text-based interface is provided for debugging
and development.</p>

<p>The files are separated according to these two modes.  <code>ants.py</code> knows
nothing of graphics or turn time limits.  All graphical elements are
specified in <code>ants_gui.py</code> and <code>graphics.py</code>.  It is possible to
complete this project without ever reading the graphics files.</p>

<p>To start a text-based game, run</p>

<pre><code>python3 ants.py</code></pre>

<p>To start a graphical game, run</p>

<pre><code>python3 ants_gui.py</code></pre>

<p>When you start the graphical version, a new window should appear:</p>

<center>
  <img src="img/gui_explanation.png" style="border: 1px solid #000;"/>
</center>

<p>In the starter implementation, you have unlimited food and your ants
only throw leaves at bees in their current <code>Place</code>.  Try playing a game
anyway!  You'll need to place a lot of <code>ThrowerAnt</code>s (the second type)
in order to keep the bees from reaching your queen.</p>

<p>The game has several options that you will use throughout the project,
which you can view with <code>&#x2d;&#x2d;help</code>.</p>

<pre><code>python3 [ants.py|ants_gui.py] [OPTIONS]
    Run the Ants vs. SomeBees project.

    &#x2d;h, &#x2d;&#x2d;help      Prints this help message
    &#x2d;t, &#x2d;&#x2d;ten       Start with ten food
    &#x2d;f, &#x2d;&#x2d;full      Loads a full layout and assault plan
    &#x2d;w, &#x2d;&#x2d;water     Loads a full layout with water
    &#x2d;i, &#x2d;&#x2d;insane    Loads a difficult assault plan</code></pre>


<h2 id="the-autograder">The Autograder</h2>

<p>We've included an autograder which includes tests for each question.
Just as in the Hog project, you will have to unlock some of the tests
first before you can use them to test your project. To unlock tests for
a particular question, run the following command from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;u q1</code></pre>

<p>Once you have unlocked the tests, you can
invoke autograder for a particular question as follows:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q1</code></pre>

<p>To help with debugging, you can also start an interactive prompt if
an error occurs by adding the <code>&#x2d;t</code> flag at the end:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q1 &#x2d;i</code></pre>

<p>You can also invoke the autograder for all problems at once using:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py</code></pre>

<p>One last note: you might have noticed a file called <code>tests.pkl</code> that
came with the project.  This file is used to store autograder tests, so
make sure <strong>not to modify it</strong>. If you need to get a fresh copy, you
can download it <a href="tests.pkl">here</a>.</p>


<h2 id="phase-1-both-partners">Phase 1 (both partners)</h2>


<h3 id="problem-1-1-pt">Problem 1 (1 pt)</h3>

<p>Answer the following questions with your partner after you have read
the <em>entire</em> <code>ants.py</code> file.  If you cannot answer these questions,
read the file again. You must get checked off by a TA or lab assistant 
in lab on 7/21 or 7/22 to receive credit for this question.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Which method in which class runs a game? (the answer is not <code>run</code>,
  because <code>run</code> is not a method)!</li>
  <li>The <code>Hive</code>, a subclass of <code>Place</code>, is the starting location of the
  bees.  Unlike most instances of <code>Place</code>, the <code>Hive</code> class does not
  have an <code>exit</code>.  Explain how and when <code>Bee</code>s leave the <code>Hive</code>.</li>
  <li>Explain the mechanism in the code by which the places in the colony
  are laid out.  How do you modify the code to produce more places?</li>
  <li>What is the significance of an <code>Insect</code>'s <code>armor</code> attribute?  What
  happens when <code>armor</code> reaches 0?</li>
  <li>Both <code>Ant</code>s and <code>Bee</code>s inherit from the <code>Insect</code> class. What does 
  this mean? What similarities and differences are there between 
  <code>Ant</code>s and <code>Bee</code>s?</li>
  <li>Locate the <code>Ant</code> class. Identify an <code>Ant</code>'s class attributes and 
  instance attributes. What is the difference between the two?</li>
</ol>


<h3 id="problem-2-2-pts">Problem 2 (2 pts)</h3>

<p>Add food costs and implement harvesters.  Currently, there is no cost
for deploying any type of <code>Ant</code>, and so there is no challenge to the
game. You'll notice that <code>Ant</code> starts out with a base <code>food_cost</code> of
zero. Override this value in each of the subclasses listed below with
the correct costs.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food</b></td>
    <td><b>Armor</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="img/ant_harvester.gif" /> <br> <code>HarvesterAnt</code></td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="img/ant_thrower.gif" /> <br> <code>ThrowerAnt</code></td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </td>
</table>

<p>Now there's no way to gather more food!  To fix this issue, implement
the <code>HarvesterAnt</code> class.  A <code>HarvesterAnt</code> is a type of <code>Ant</code> that
adds one food to the <code>colony.food</code> total as its <code>action</code>.</p>

<p>After unlocking tests for Q2, you can use the autograder:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;u 2
python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q 2 &#x2d;i</code></pre>

<p>Try playing the game again.  Once you have placed a <code>HarvesterAnt</code>, you
should accumulate food each turn.  Vanquishing the bees using the
default game setup is now possible.</p>


<h3 id="problem-3-1-pt">Problem 3 (1 pt)</h3>

<p>Add code to the <code>Place</code> constructor that tracks entrances.  Right now,
a <code>Place</code> keeps track only of its <code>exit</code>.  We would like a <code>Place</code> to
keep track of its entrance as well.  A <code>Place</code> needs to track only one
<code>entrance</code>.</p>

<p>However, simply passing an entrance to a <code>Place</code> constructor will be
problematic; we will need to have both the exit and the entrance before
we can create a <code>Place</code>! (It's a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg">chicken or the
egg</a>
problem.) To get around this problem, we will keep track of entrances
in the following way instead.  The <code>Place</code> constructor should specify
that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A newly created <code>Place</code> always starts with its <code>entrance</code> as <code>None</code>.</li>
  <li>If the <code>Place</code> has an <code>exit</code>, then the <code>exit</code>'s <code>entrance</code> is set to
  that <code>Place</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>After unlocking tests for Q3, you can use the autograder:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;u 3
python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q 3 &#x2d;i</code></pre>


<h2 id="phase-2-water-and-fire-person-a">Phase 2: Water and Fire (person A)</h2>


<h3 id="problem-a4-2-pts">Problem A4 (2 pts)</h3>

<p>Add water to the colony.  Currently there are only two types of places,
the <code>Hive</code> and a basic <code>Place</code>.  To make things more interesting, we're
going to create a new type of <code>Place</code> called <code>Water</code>.</p>

<p>Only an ant that is <code>watersafe</code> can be deployed to a <code>Water</code> place.  In
order to determine whether an <code>Insect</code> is <code>watersafe</code>, add a new
attribute to the <code>Insect</code> class named <code>watersafe</code> that is <code>False</code> by
default.  Since bees can fly, make their <code>watersafe</code> attribute <code>True</code>,
overriding the default.</p>

<p>Now, implement the <code>add_insect</code> method for <code>Water</code>.  First call
<code>Place.add_insect</code> to add the insect, regardless of whether it is
watersafe. Then, if the insect is not watersafe, reduce the insect's
armor to 0 by invoking <code>reduce_armor</code>. <strong>Do not</strong> copy and paste code.
Try to use methods that have already been defined and make use of
inheritance to reuse the functionality of the <code>Place</code> class.</p>

<p>After unlocking tests for Q4, you can use the autograder:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;u A4
python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q A4 &#x2d;i</code></pre>

<p>Once you've finished this problem, play a game that includes water.  To
access the <code>mixed_layout</code> that includes water, add the <code>&#x2d;&#x2d;water</code> option
(or <code>&#x2d;w</code> for short) when you start the game.</p>

<pre><code>python3 ants_gui.py &#x2d;&#x2d;water</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-a5-3-pts">Problem A5 (3 pts)</h3>

<p>Implement the <code>FireAnt</code>.  A <code>FireAnt</code> has a special <code>reduce_armor</code>
method: when the <code>FireAnt</code>'s armor reaches zero or lower, it will
reduce the armor of <em>all</em> <code>Bee</code>s in the same <code>Place</code> as the <code>FireAnt</code>
by its <code>damage</code> attribute (defaults to <code>3</code>).</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food</b></td>
    <td><b>Armor</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="img/ant_fire.gif" /> <br> <code>FireAnt</code></td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </td>
</table>

<p><em>Hint:</em> If you iterate over a list, but change the contents of that
list at the same time, you may not see all the elements.  As the
<a href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements">Python
tutorial</a>
suggests, "If you need to modify the list you are iterating over, you
must iterate over a copy." Remember that damaging a bee may cause it to
be removed from its place.</p>

<p>Once you've finished implementing the <code>FireAnt</code>, give it a class
attribute <code>implemented</code> with the value <code>True</code>.  This attribute tells
the game that you've added a new type of <code>Ant</code>.</p>

<p>After unlocking tests for QA5, you can use the autograder:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;u A5
python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q A5 &#x2d;i</code></pre>

<p>After implementing <code>FireAnt</code>, be sure to test your program by playing a
game or two!  A <code>FireAnt</code> should destroy any co-located Bees when it
dies.  To start a game with ten food, use <code>&#x2d;&#x2d;ten</code>.</p>


<h2 id="phase-2-extended-range-person-b">Phase 2: Extended Range (person B)</h2>


<h3 id="problem-b4-2-pts">Problem B4 (2 pts)</h3>

<p>Implement the <code>nearest_bee</code> method for the <code>ThrowerAnt</code> class.  In
order for a <code>ThrowerAnt</code> to attack, it must know which bee it should
hit.  The provided implementation will only hit bees in the same
<code>Place</code>.  Your job is to fix it so that a <code>ThrowerAnt</code> will <code>throw_at</code>
the nearest bee in front of it that is not still in the <code>Hive</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>nearest_bee</code> method returns a random <code>Bee</code> from the nearest place
that contains bees.  Places are inspected in order by following their
<code>entrance</code> attributes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start from the current <code>Place</code> of the <code>ThrowerAnt</code>.</li>
  <li>For each place, return a random bee if there is any, or consider the
  next place that is stored as the current place's <code>entrance</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>After unlocking tests for QB4, you can use the autograder:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;u B4
python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q B4 &#x2d;i</code></pre>

<p>After implementing <code>nearest_bee</code>, a <code>ThrowerAnt</code> should be able to
<code>throw_at</code> a <code>Bee</code> in front of it that is not still in the <code>Hive</code>.
Make sure that your ants do the right thing! To start a game with ten
food, use <code>&#x2d;&#x2d;ten</code>.</p>


<h3 id="problem-b5-3-pts">Problem B5 (3 pts)</h3>

<p>Now that the <code>ThrowerAnt</code> has been completed, implement two subclasses
of <code>ThrowerAnt</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>LongThrower</code> can only <code>throw_at</code> a <code>Bee</code> that is found after
  following at least 4 <code>entrance</code> transitions.  So the <code>LongThrower</code>
  can't hit <code>Bee</code>s that are in the same <code>Place</code> as it or the first 3
  <code>Place</code>s in front of it. If there are two <code>Bees</code>, one too close to
  the <code>LongThrower</code> and the other within its range, the <code>LongThrower</code>
  should throw past the closer <code>Bee</code>, instead targeting the farther
  one, which is within its range.</li>
  <li>The <code>ShortThrower</code> can only <code>throw_at</code> a <code>Bee</code> that is found after
  following at most 2 <code>entrance</code> transitions.  So the <code>ShortThrower</code>
  can only hit <code>Bee</code>s in the same <code>Place</code> as it and 2 <code>Place</code>s in front
  of it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of these specialized throwers can <code>throw_at</code> a <code>Bee</code> that is
exactly 3 <code>Place</code>s away.  Placing a single one of these (and no other
ants) should never win a default game.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food</b></td>
    <td><b>Armor</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="img/ant_shortthrower.gif" /> <br>
      <code>ShortThrower</code></td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="img/ant_longthrower.gif" /> <br> <code>LongThrower</code></td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>To implement these behaviors, modify the <code>nearest_bee</code> method to
reference <code>min_range</code> and <code>max_range</code> attributes, and only return a bee
that is in range.</p>

<p>For the base class, <code>ThrowerAnt</code>, set <code>min_range</code> to 0 and <code>max_range</code>
to <code>float(&#x27;inf&#x27;)</code>, since a <code>ThrowerAnt</code> can throw at any bee in front of 
it.  Then, implement the subclasses <code>LongThrower</code> and <code>ShortThrower</code> 
with appropriately constrained ranges and correct food costs.</p>

<p>Set the <code>implemented</code> class attribute of <code>LongThrower</code> and
<code>ShortThrower</code> to <code>True</code>.</p>

<p>After unlocking tests for QB5, you can use the autograder:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;u B5
python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q B5 &#x2d;i</code></pre>

<p>Try playing a game with your newly implemented ants.  Be sure that they
do what you expect them to!  You can try running <code>ants_gui.py</code> with the
<code>&#x2d;&#x2d;full</code> option to go up against a full swarm of bees in a multi-tunnel
layout, and add <code>&#x2d;&#x2d;insane</code> if you want a real challenge!  If the bees
are too numerous to vanquish, you might need to create some new ants in
Phase 2.</p>


<h2 id="phase-3-seen-and-unseen-person-a">Phase 3: Seen and Unseen (person A)</h2>


<h3 id="problem-a6-1-pt">Problem A6 (1 pt)</h3>

<p>We are going to add some protection to our glorious <code>AntColony</code> by
implementing the <code>WallAnt</code>, which is an ant that does nothing each turn
(already the default <code>action</code> of the <code>Ant</code> class).  A <code>WallAnt</code> is
useful because it has a large <code>armor</code> value.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food</b></td>
    <td><b>Armor</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="img/ant_wall.gif" /> <br> <code>WallAnt</code></td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </td>
</table>

<p>Unlike with previous ants, we have not provided you with a class header.
Make sure that you give it a class attribute <code>name</code> with the value <code>Wall</code>
and a class attribute <code>implemented</code> with the value <code>True</code> after you've
finished.</p>

<p>After unlocking tests for QA6, you can use the autograder:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;u A6
python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q A6 &#x2d;i</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-a7-3-pts">Problem A7 (3 pts)</h3>

<p>Implement the <code>NinjaAnt</code>, which damages all <code>Bee</code>s that pass by, but is
never seen.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food</b></td>
    <td><b>Armor</b></td>

  <tr>
    <td><img src="img/ant_ninja.gif" /> <br> <code>NinjaAnt</code></td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </td>
</table>

<p>A <code>NinjaAnt</code> is not able to be attacked by a <code>Bee</code> because it is
hidden, nor does it block the path of a <code>Bee</code> that flies by.  To
implement this behavior, first modify the <code>Ant</code> class to include a new
class attribute <code>blocks_path</code> that is <code>True</code> by default.  Set the value
of <code>blocks_path</code> to <code>False</code> in the <code>NinjaAnt</code> class.</p>

<p>Second, modify the <code>Bee</code>'s method <code>blocked</code> to return <code>False</code> if either
there is no <code>Ant</code> in the <code>Bee</code>'s <code>place</code> or if there is an <code>Ant</code>, but
its <code>blocks_path</code> attribute is <code>False</code>.  Now <code>Bee</code>s will just fly past
<code>NinjaAnt</code>s.</p>

<p>Finally, we want to make the <code>NinjaAnt</code> damage all <code>Bee</code>'s that fly
past.  Implement the <code>action</code> method in <code>NinjaAnt</code> to reduce the armor
of all <code>Bee</code>s in the same <code>place</code> as the <code>NinjaAnt</code> by 1, overriding
the default action method inherited from <code>Ant</code>.  Make sure you also
override the <code>damage</code> class variable (and use <code>damage</code>, of course).</p>

<p>Currently there are no ants that can be placed on <code>Water</code>.  Implement
the <code>ScubaThrower</code>, which is a subclass of <code>ThrowerAnt</code> that is more
costly and <code>watersafe</code>, but otherwise identical to its base class.</p>

<table class="ant">

<p>Placing a <code>ScubaAnt</code> in <code>Water</code> should not cause it to die.</p>

<p>Like with <code>WallAnt</code>, we have not provided you with a class header.

<p>We will now implement the new offensive unit called the <code>HungryAnt</code>,
which will eat a random <code>Bee</code> from its <code>place</code>, instantly killing the
<code>Bee</code>.  After eating a <code>Bee</code>, it must spend 3 turns digesting before
eating again.</p>

<table class="ant">

    <td><b>Class</b></td>

    <td>4</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </td>
</table>

<p>To implement, give <code>HungryAnt</code> a <code>time_to_digest</code> class attribute that
holds the number of turns that it takes all <code>HungryAnt</code>s to digest
(default to 3).  Also, give each <code>HungryAnt</code> an instance attribute
<code>digesting</code> that counts the number of turns it has left to digest
(default is 0, since it hasn't eaten anything at the beginning).</p>

<p>Now we implement the <code>action</code> method of the <code>HungryAnt</code> to check if
it's digesting; if so, decrement its <code>digesting</code> counter.  Otherwise,
eat a random <code>Bee</code> in its <code>place</code> (killing the <code>Bee</code> and restarting the
<code>digesting</code> timer).</p>

<h3 id="problem-8-4-pts">Problem 8 (4 pts)</h3>

<p>Implement the <code>BodyguardAnt</code>. Right now, our ants are quite frail. We'd
like to provide a way to help them last longer against the onslaught of
the bees. Enter the <code>BodyguardAnt</code>.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food</b></td>
    <td><b>Armor</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="img/ant_weeds.gif" /> <br> <code>BodyguardAnt</code></td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>A <code>BodyguardAnt</code> differs from a normal <code>Ant</code> because it can occupy the
same <code>Place</code> as another ant.  When a <code>BodyguardAnt</code> is added to the
same <code>Place</code> as another ant, it shields the other ant and protects it
from damage.  Attacks should damage the <code>BodyguardAnt</code> first and only
hurt the protected ant after the <code>BodyguardAnt</code> has perished.</p>

<p>A <code>BodyguardAnt</code> has an instance attribute <code>ant</code> that stores the ant
contained within the bodyguard.  It should start off as <code>None</code>,
indicating that no ant is currently being protected.  Give
<code>BodyguardAnt</code> a <code>contain_ant</code> method that takes an <code>Ant</code> argument and
sets the <code>ant</code> instance attribute to that argument.</p>

<p>Now, change your program so that a <code>BodyguardAnt</code> and another <code>Ant</code> can
simultaneously occupy the same <code>Place</code>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add an <code>Ant.container</code> class attribute that indicates whether an ant
  can contain another.  For all <code>Ant</code>s except <code>BodyguardAnt</code>,
  <code>container</code> should be <code>False</code>.  The <code>BodyguardAnt.container</code>
  attribute should be <code>True</code>.</li>
  <li><p>We also need to give <code>Ant</code>s a new method, <code>can_contain</code>, that takes
  an <code>other</code> ant as an argument and returns <code>True</code> if and only if:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>This ant is a container.</li>
    <li>This ant does not already contain another ant.</li>
    <li>The other ant is not a container.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li><p>Right now, if we attempt to put a second ant in a <code>Place</code>, the
  <code>add_insect</code> method of the <code>Place</code> class will immediately cause an
  error.  Change <code>add_insect</code> so that the <code>Place</code> contains the
  container ant and the container ant contains the other ant:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the <code>Ant</code> currently occupying this <code>Place</code> can contain the
    <code>Ant</code> we are trying to add, then simply tell it to do so.</li>
    <li>If the <code>Ant</code> we are trying to add can contain the <code>Ant</code> currently
    occupying this <code>Place</code>, then have it do so <em>and</em> set this
    <code>Place</code>'s ant to be the newly added <code>Ant</code>.</li>
    <li>If neither <code>Ant</code> can contain the other, then raise the same
    assertion error as before.</li>
    <li><em>Hint:</em> Remember that you can quit out of a function at any point
    by just saying <code>return</code>.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Almost done!  Just a few more things to do.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If a <code>BodyguardAnt</code> containing another ant is removed, then the ant
  it is containing should be placed where the <code>BodyguardAnt</code> used to
  be. Update the <code>remove_insect</code> method in the <code>Place</code> class
  accordingly.</li>
  <li>The last step is to make sure that ants that are contained by
  <code>BodyguardAnt</code>s still perform their action.  Override the <code>action</code>
  method for <code>BodyguardAnt</code> accordingly.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="problem-9-5-pts">Problem 9 (5 pts)</h3>

<p>Implement the <code>QueenAnt</code>. The queen is a waterproof <code>ScubaThrower</code> that
inspires her fellow ants through her bravery. Whenever the queen throws
a leaf, she also doubles the damage of all other ants in the same
tunnel with her, including any ants protected by a bodyguard. Once any
ant's damage has doubled, it cannot be doubled again.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food</b></td>
    <td><b>Armor</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="img/ant_queen.gif" /> <br> <code>QueenAnt</code></td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>However, with great power comes great responsibility.  The Queen is
governed by three special rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>If a bee ever enters the place occupied by the queen, then the bees
  immediately win the game. The game ends even if the queen is
  protected by a bodyguard. The bees also win if any bee reaches the
  end of a tunnel where the queen normally would reside.</p>

  <p>In <code>AntColony.simulate</code>, the bees win the game whenever
  <code>len(self.queen.bees) &gt; 0</code>, where <code>self</code> is the ant colony.
  Normally, the <code>queen</code> attribute of an <code>AntColony</code> is an instance of
  a <code>Place</code>.  As part of the <code>action</code> of a <code>QueenAnt</code>, the
  <code>colony.queen</code> should be replaced by a new object, a <code>QueenPlace</code>. A
  <code>QueenPlace</code> has a <code>bees</code> property method that evaluates to the list
  of all bees that are either in the original <code>colony.queen</code> location
  or the <code>place</code> of the <code>QueenAnt</code>.</p>

  <p>You should not have to change the implementation of
  <code>AntColony.simulate</code> or manipulate the location of bees in any
  special way. You may assume that a <code>colony.queen</code> attribute will be
  used for only one purpose: to check whether <code>len(self.queen.bees) &gt;
  0</code>.  Thus, a <code>QueenPlace</code> instance does not need to support other
  <code>Place</code> methods, such as <code>add_insect</code>.</p></li>
  <li>There can be only one true queen. Any queen beyond the first one is
  an impostor and should die immediately (its armor reduced to 0) upon
  taking its first action, without doubling any ant's damage or
  throwing anything. Impostor queens should not affect the colony's
  <code>queen</code> attribute. You can detect impostor queens by counting the
  number of times that an instance of a <code>QueenAnt</code> has been
  constructed, using a class attribute.  Any <code>QueenAnt</code> beyond the
  first one created is an impostor. You should not have to search
  through the colony places to find other queens.</li>
  <li>The true (first) queen cannot be removed. Attempts to remove the
  queen should have no effect (but should not cause an error). You
  will need to modify the <code>remove_insect</code> method of <code>Place</code> to enforce
  this condition.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can find every <code>Place</code> in a tunnel by starting at one <code>Place</code> and
  then repeatedly follow both its <code>exit</code> and <code>entrance</code> attributes to
  the ends.</li>
  <li>To detect whether a <code>Place</code> is at the end of a tunnel, check whether
  its <code>exit</code> or <code>entrance</code> is <code>None</code>.</li>
  <li>To make sure that you don't double the damage of the same ant twice,
  keep a list of all the ants that have been doubled.</li>
</ul>

<p>Implement two final thrower ants that do no damage, but instead replace
the <code>action</code> method of a <code>Bee</code> instance that they <code>throw_at</code> with a new
method that alters the <code>Bee</code>'s behavior for some duration.</p>

<p>We will be implementing two new ants that subclass <code>ThrowerAnt</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>SlowThrower</code> applies a slow effect for 3 turns.</li>
  <li><code>StunThrower</code> applies a stun effect for 1 turn.</li>
</ul>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food</b></td>
    <td><b>Armor</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="img/ant_freeze.gif" /> <br> <code>SlowThrower</code></td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="img/ant_stun.gif" /> <br> <code>StunThrower</code></td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>In order to complete the implementations of these two ants, you will
need to set their class attributes appropriately and implement the
following three functions:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>make_slow</code> takes an <code>action</code> method and returns a new <code>action</code>
  method which performs the original action on turns where
  <code>colony.time</code> is even and does nothing on other turns.</li>
  <li><code>make_stun</code> takes an <code>action</code> method and returns a new <code>action</code>
  method which does nothing.</li>
  <li><code>apply_effect</code> takes an <code>effect</code> (either <code>make_slow</code> or
  <code>make_stun</code>), a <code>bee</code>, and a <code>duration</code>.  It then takes the bee's
  original action along with the "affected action" (the result of
  calling <code>effect</code> on the original action) and replaces the bee's
  action with a new action method that will call the affected action
  for <code>duration</code> turns and then will go back to calling the original
  action every turn.</li>
</ol>

<p>After unlocking tests for the Extra Credit, you can use the autograder:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;u EC
python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q EC &#x2d;i</code></pre>

<p>Make sure to test your code!  Your code should be able to apply
multiple effects on a target (each new effect applies on top of
whatever action method the bee already has at that point, and the
target returns to the previous action when the new one runs out).</p>

<p><strong>You are now done with the project!</strong>  If you weren't able to vanquish
the bees' insane-mode assault plan before, do your new ants help?  Add
some water or design your own layout to keep things interesting.</p>

<p>Feel free to design additional ants, layouts, and assault plans and
post them to Piazza.</p>
