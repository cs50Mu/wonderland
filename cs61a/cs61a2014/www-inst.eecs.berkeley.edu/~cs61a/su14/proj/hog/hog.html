<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In this project, you will develop a simulator and multiple strategies
for the dice game Hog. You will need to use control and higher-order
functions together, from Sections 1.1 through 1.6 of the <a href="http://composingprograms.com/pages/11-getting-started.html">Composing
Programs</a> online text.</p>

<p>In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to reach 100 points first.
On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll,
up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the dice
outcomes, unless any of the dice come up a 1, in which case the score
for the turn is only 1 point (the <strong>Pig out</strong> rule).</p>

<p>To spice up the game, we will play with some special rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Free bacon</strong>.  A player who chooses to roll zero dice scores one
  more than the largest digit in the opponent's score. For example, if
  Player 1 has 42 points, Player 0 gains 1 + max(4, 2) = 5 points by
  rolling zero dice.  If Player 1 has 48 points, Player 0 gains 1 +
  max(4, 8) = 9 points.</li>
  <li><strong>Hog wild</strong>. If the sum of both players' total scores is a multiple
  of seven (e.g., 14, 21, 35), then the current player rolls four-sided
  dice instead of the usual six-sided dice.</li>
  <li><p><strong>Swine swap</strong>. If at the end of a turn one of the player's total
  score is exactly double the other's, then the players swap total
  scores.</p>

  <p><em>Example 1:</em> Player 0 has 20 points and Player 1 has 5; it is Player
  1's turn. Player 1 scores 5 more, bringing the total to 10. The
  players swap scores: Player 0 now has 10 points and Player 1 has 20.
  It is now Player 0's turn.</p>

  <p><em>Example 2</em>: Player 0 has 90 points and Player 1 has 50; it is Player
  0's turn.  Player 0 scores 10 more, for a total of 100.  The players
  swap scores, and Player 1 wins the game 100 to 50.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This project includes seven files, but all of your changes will be made
to the first one, and it is the only one you should need to read and
understand. To get started, <strong>download</strong> all of the project code as a
<a href="hog.zip">zip archive</a></p>

<p>The autograder also uses a file called <a href="tests.pkl">tests.pkl</a>. This file is
included in the zip archive.</p>


<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>

<p>This is a one-week solo project.  You should not share your code with
other students.</p>

<p>Start early! The amount of time it takes to complete a project (or any
program) is unpredictable.</p>

<p>You are not alone! Ask for help early and often &mdash; the TAs, lab
assistants, and your fellow students are here to help. Try attending
office hours or posting on Piazza.</p>

<p>In the end, you will submit one project. The project is worth 20
points. 17 points are assigned for correctness, and 3 points for the
overall <a href="../../composition.html">composition</a> of your program.</p>

<p>The only file that you are required to submit is <code>hog.py</code>. You do not
need to modify or turn in any other files to complete the project. To
submit the project, change to the directory where <code>hog.py</code> is located
and run <code>submit proj1</code>.  We will start running the autograder at least
two days before the due date.</p>

<p>For the functions that we ask you to complete, there may be some
initial code that we provide. If you would rather not use that code,
feel free to delete it and start from scratch. You may also add new
function definitions as you see fit.</p>

<p>However, please do <strong>not</strong> modify any other functions.  Doing so may
result in your code failing our autograder tests. Also, do not change
any function signatures (names, argument order, or number of
arguments).</p>


<h2 id="graphical-user-interface">Graphical User Interface</h2>

<p>A <strong>graphical user interface</strong> (GUI, for short) is provided for you. At
the moment, it doesn't work, because you haven't implemented the game
logic.  Once you finish Problem 4 (the <code>play</code> function), you will be
able to play a fully interactive version of Hog!</p>

<p>In order to render the graphics, make sure you have Tkinter, Python's
main graphics library, installed on your computer. Once you've done
that, you can run the GUI from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py</code></pre>

<p>Once you're done with Problem 9, you can play against the final
strategy that you've created!</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py &#x2d;f</code></pre>


<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>Throughout this project, you should be testing the correctness of your
code.  It is good practice to test often, so that it is easy to isolate
any problems.</p>

<p>We have provided an <strong>autograder</strong> to help you with testing your code,
but there is a catch. At first, most of the test cases are <em>locked</em>. To
unlock tests for a particular question, run the following command from
your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;u q1</code></pre>

<p>This command will start an interactive prompt that looks like
this:</p>

<pre><code>Unlocking tests for q1
======================
At each &quot;?&quot;, type in what you would expect the output to be if you had
implemented q1

&gt;&gt;&gt; counted_dice = make_test_dice(4, 1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; roll_dice(2, make_test_dice(4, 6, 1))
? </code></pre>

<p>At the <code>?</code>, you can type what you expect the output to be. If you get
it right, the test case you answered will be available the next time
you run the autograder.</p>

<p>The idea is to understand <em>conceptually</em> what your program should do
first, before you start writing any code. In general, it is good
practice to think through your program first instead of blindly writing
code.</p>

<p>Once you have unlocked some tests and written some code, you check the
correctness of your program using the tests that you unlocked:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q q1</code></pre>

<p>This will run the autograder on all unlocked tests for question 1. For
example, the following output shows an error in question 1:</p>

<pre><code>Test Q1
=======
Test case failed:
&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;
&gt;&gt;&gt; counted_dice = make_test_dice(4, 1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; roll_dice(2, make_test_dice(4, 6, 1))
None
# Error: expected ... got None</code></pre>

<p>To help with debugging, <code>autograder.py</code> also provides an interactive
session with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q q1 &#x2d;i</code></pre>

<p>If an error occurs, the autograder will open an interactive Python
shell for you to use:</p>

<pre><code>Test Q1
=======
&gt;&gt;&gt; counted_dice = make_test_dice(4, 1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; roll_dice(2, make_test_dice(4, 6, 1))
None
# Error: expected ... got None
# Interactive console
# Type exit() to quit
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>

<p>One last note: you might have noticed a file called <code>tests.pkl</code> that
came with the project.  This file is used to store autograder tests, so
make sure <strong>not to modify it</strong>. If you need to get a fresh copy, you
can download it <a href="tests.pkl">here</a>.</p>


<h2 id="phase-1-simulator">Phase 1: Simulator</h2>

<p>In the first phase, you will develop a simulator for the game of Hog.</p>


<h3 id="problem-0-0-pts">Problem 0 (0 pts)</h3>

<p>Before we start writing any code, let's take a look at the autograder.
As mentioned in the <a href="hog.html#testing">Testing section</a>, the autograder's test
cases are initially locked.  You will need to unlock test cases before
you can use the autograder to test your code!</p>

<p>To unlock test cases for Problem 1 (see below), use the following
command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;u q1</code></pre>

<p>This should display a prompt that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Unlocking tests for Q1
======================
At each &quot;?&quot;, type in what you would expect the output to be if you had
implemented Q1
Type exit() to quit

&gt;&gt;&gt; roll_dice(2, make_test_dice(4, 6, 1))
?</code></pre>

<p>As noted in the prompt, you should type in what you expect the output
to be. To do so, you need to first figure out what <code>roll_dice</code> does.
<strong>Note</strong>: <code>roll_dice</code> does not actually work yet, because you haven't
written code for it (that's for Problem 1); you are just filling in
what you would <em>expect</em> it to return.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>roll_dice</code> function takes two arguments: the number of dice to
  roll; and a <code>dice</code> function. The <code>dice</code> function should be called
  <em>exactly</em> the number of times specified by the first argument, even
  if a 1 is rolled.  <code>roll_dice</code> should return the sum of all dice
  rolls if no 1's are rolled, or it should return 1 if at least one 1
  was rolled.</li>
  <li>The <code>make_test_dice</code> function creates a special <code>dice</code> function that
  is <em>deterministic</em> (i.e.  non-random). The outcomes of this <code>dice</code>
  will cycle through the inputs of <code>make_test_dice</code>. In the example
  above, the first roll would be 4, the second roll would be 6, the
  third roll would be 1, and the fourth roll would cycle back to
  4.</lli></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> you can exit the unlocker by typing "exit()" (without
quotes). <strong>Typing Ctrl-C to exit out of the unlocker has been known to
cause problems, so avoid using that to quit.</strong></p>

<p>Unlock the tests for Problem 1. When you are done, you will be able to
use the autograder to test your code:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q q1</code></pre>

<p>This will display the following output:</p>

<pre><code>Test Q1
=======
Test case failed:
&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;
&gt;&gt;&gt; roll_dice(2, make_test_dice(4, 6, 1))
None
# Error: expected ... got None</code></pre>

<p>Proceed to Problem 1 to start writing code!</p>


<h3 id="problem-1-2-pts">Problem 1 (2 pts)</h3>

<p>The <code>roll_dice</code> function in <code>hog.py</code> returns the number of points
scored by rolling a fixed positive number of dice: either the sum of
the dice or 1. To obtain a single outcome of a dice roll, call
<code>dice()</code>. You should call this function <em>exactly</em> <code>num_rolls</code> times in
your implementation. The only rule you need to consider for this
problem is <em>Pig out</em>.</p>

<p>You should have unlocked the autograder test cases in <a href="hog.html#problem-0-2-pts">Problem
0</a>. To test the correctness of your implementation
with your unlocked tests, use this command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q q1</code></pre>

<p>You can also open an interactive Python shell if an error occurs by
adding a <code>&#x2d;i</code> option to the end:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q q1 &#x2d;i</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-2-1-pt">Problem 2 (1 pt)</h3>

<p>The <code>take_turn</code> function, which returns the number of points scored for
the turn.  You will need to implement the <em>Free bacon</em> rule here.  You
can assume that <code>opponent_score</code> is less than 100. Your implementation
should call <code>roll_dice</code>.</p>

<p>Unlock, implement and test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;u q2
python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q q2</code></pre>

<p>As before, you can also open an interactive Python shell if an error
occurs by adding a <code>&#x2d;i</code> option to the end:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q q2 &#x2d;i</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-3-1-pt">Problem 3 (1 pt)</h3>

<p><code>select_dice</code> is a helper function that will simplify the
implementation of <code>play</code> (next problem). The function <code>select_dice</code>
helps enforce the <em>Hog wild</em> special rule. This function takes two
arguments: the scores for the current and opposing players.</p>

<p>Unlock, implement and test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;u q3
python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q q3</code></pre>

<p>As before, you can also open an interactive Python shell if an error
occurs by adding a <code>&#x2d;i</code>option to the end:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q q3 &#x2d;i</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-4-3-pt">Problem 4 (3 pt)</h3>

<p>Finally, implement the <code>play</code> function, which simulates a full game of
Hog. Players alternate turns, each using the strategy originally
supplied, until one of the players reaches the <code>goal</code> score. When the
game ends, <code>play</code> returns the final total scores of both players, with
Player 0's score first, and Player 1's score second.</p>

<p>Here are some hints:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remember to enforce all the special rules! You should enforce the
  <em>Hog wild</em> special rule here (by using <code>select_dice</code>), as well as the
  <em>Swine swap</em> special rule here.</li>
  <li>You should use the <code>take_turn</code> function that you've already written.</li>
  <li>You can get the value of the other player (either 0 or 1) by calling
  the provided function <code>other</code>. For example, <code>other(0)</code> evaluates to
  1.</li>
  <li>A <em>strategy</em> is a function that determines how many dice a player
  wants to roll, depending on the scores of both players. A strategy
  function (such as <code>strategy0</code> and <code>strategy1</code>) takes two arguments:
  scores for the current player and opposing player. A strategy
  function returns the number of dice that the current player wants to
  roll in the turn. Don't worry about details of implementing
  strategies yet. You will develop them in Phase 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlock, implement and test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;u q4
python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q q4</code></pre>

<p>Once you are finished, you will be able to play a graphical version of
the game. We have provided a file called <code>hog_gui.py</code> that
you can run from the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py</code></pre>

<p>If you don't already have Tkinter (Python's graphics library)
installed, you'll need to install it first before you can run the GUI.</p>

<p>The GUI relies on your implementation, so if you have any bugs in your
code, they will be reflected in the GUI. This means you can also use
the GUI as a debugging tool; however, it's better to run the tests
first.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have finished Phase 1 of this project!</p>


<h2 id="phase-2-strategies">Phase 2: Strategies</h2>

<p>In the second phase, you will experiment with ways to improve upon the
basic strategy of always rolling a fixed number of dice. First, you need to
develop some tools to evaluate strategies.</p>


<h3 id="problem-5-2-pts">Problem 5 (2 pts)</h3>

<p>Implement the <code>make_averaged</code> function. This higher-order function
takes a function <code>fn</code> as an argument. It returns another function that
takes the same number of arguments as the original. This returned
function differs from the input function in that it returns the average
value of repeatedly calling <code>fn</code> on the same arguments. This function
should call <code>fn</code> a total of <code>num_samples</code> times and return the average
of the results.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> If the input function <code>fn</code> is a non-pure function (for
instance, the <code>random</code> function), then <code>make_averaged</code> will also be a
non-pure function.</p>

<p>To implement this function, you need a new piece of Python syntax! You
must write a function that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments,
then calls another function using exactly those arguments. Here's how
it works.</p>

<p>Instead of listing formal parameters for a function, we write <code>*args</code>.
To call another function using exactly those arguments, we call it
again with <code>*args</code>. For example,</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def printed(fn):
...     def print_and_return(*args):
...         result = fn(*args)
...         print(&#x27;Result:&#x27;, result)
...         return result
...     return print_and_return
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_pow = printed(pow)
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_pow(2, 8)
Result: 256
256</code></pre>

<p>Read the docstring for <code>make_averaged</code> carefully to understand how it
is meant to work.</p>

<p>Unlock, implement and test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;u q5
python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q q5</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-6-2-pts">Problem 6 (2 pts)</h3>

<p>Implement the <code>max_scoring_num_rolls</code> function, which runs an
experiment to determine the number of rolls (from 1 to 10) that gives
the maximum average score for a turn.  Your implementation should use
<code>make_averaged</code> and <code>roll_dice</code>.  It should print out the average for
each possible number of rolls, as in the doctest for
<code>max_scoring_num_rolls</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> if two numbers of rolls are tied for the maximum average
score, return the lower number. For example, if both 3 and 6 achieve a
maximum average score, return 3.</p>

<p>Autograder tests for this question have already been unlocked for you!
Test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<p>Unlock, implement and test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;u q6
python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q q5</code></pre>

<p>To run this experiment on randomized dice, call <code>run_experiments</code> using
the <code>&#x2d;r</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog.py &#x2d;r</code></pre>

<p><strong>Running experiments</strong> For the remainder of this project,
you can change the implementation of <code>run_experiments</code> as you wish.
By calling <code>average_win_rate</code>, you can evaluate various Hog
strategies. For example, change the first <code>if False:</code> to <code>if
True:</code> in order to evaluate <code>always_roll(8)</code> against the
baseline strategy of <code>always_roll(5)</code>.  You should find that it loses
more often than it wins, giving a win rate below 0.5.</p>

<p>Some of the experiments may take up to a minute to run. You can always reduce
the number of samples in <code>make_averaged</code> to speed up experiments.</p>


<h3 id="problem-7-1-pt">Problem 7 (1 pt)</h3>

<p>A strategy can take advantage of the <em>Free bacon</em> rule by rolling 0
when it is most beneficial to do so.  Implement <code>bacon_strategy</code>, which
returns 0 whenever rolling 0 would give <strong>at least</strong> <code>margin</code> points
and returns <code>num_rolls</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>Unlock, implement and test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;u q7
python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q q7</code></pre>

<p>Once you have implemented this strategy, change <code>run_experiments</code>
to evaluate your new strategy against the baseline. You should find that it
wins more than half of the time.</p>


<h3 id="problem-8-2-pt">Problem 8 (2 pt)</h3>

<p>A strategy can also take advantage of the <em>Swine swap</em> rule. The
<code>swap_strategy</code></p>

<ol>
  <li>Rolls 0 if it would cause a beneficial swap that gains points.</li>
  <li>Rolls <code>num_rolls</code> if rolling 0 would cause a harmful swap that loses
  points.</li>
  <li>If rolling 0 would not cause a swap, then do so if it would give
  <strong>at least</strong> <code>margin</code> points and roll <code>num_rolls</code> otherwise.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unlock, implement and test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;u q8
python3 autograder.py &#x2d;q q8</code></pre>

<p>Once you have implemented this strategy, update <code>run_experiments</code> to
evaluate your new strategy against the baseline.  You should find that
it performs even better than <code>bacon_strategy</code>, on average.</p>

<p>At this point, run the entire autograder to see if there are any tests
that don't pass.</p>

<pre><code>python3 autograder.py &#x2d;a</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-9-3-pts">Problem 9 (3 pts)</h3>

<p>Implement <code>final_strategy</code>, which combines these ideas and any other
ideas you have to achieve a win rate of at least 0.59 (for full credit)
against the baseline <code>always_roll(5)</code> strategy.  (At the very least,
try to achieve a win rate above 0.54 for partial credit.) Some ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find a way to leave your opponent with four-sided dice more often.</li>
  <li>If you are in the lead, you might take fewer risks. If you are
  losing, you might take bigger risks to catch up.</li>
  <li>Vary your rolls based on whether you will be rolling four-sided or
  six- sided dice.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note</em>: You may want to increase the number of samples to improve the
approximation of your win rate. The course autograder will compute your
exact average win rate (without sampling error) for you once you submit
your project, and it will <strong>send it to you in an email</strong>.</p>

<p>You can also play against your final strategy with the graphical user
interface:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py &#x2d;f</code></pre>

<p>The GUI will alternate which player is controlled by you.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you have reached the end of your first CS 61A project!</p>
