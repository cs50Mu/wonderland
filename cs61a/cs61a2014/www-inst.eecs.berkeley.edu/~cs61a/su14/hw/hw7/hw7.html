<p>This assignment is a bit different from the rest. For the first half, you'll be
using dictionaries to create your own Shakespearean sentences. In the
second half, you'll be diving into cryptography and using what you've learned
this week to create a cypher. <em>The entire second half of this assignment is
optional</em>. While it is good practice on the material for this week, you don't 
have to turn it in to get full points for this assignment. You worked very hard 
last week, so hopefully this homework will be a bit of a break.

<h2 id="dictionaries-and-shakespeare">Dictionaries and Shakespeare</h2>


<p>Now that you know how dictionaries work, we can approximate the 
entire works of Shakespeare! We're going to use a bigram language 
model. Here's the idea: We start with some word &mdash; we'll use "The" 
as an example. Then we look through all of the texts of Shakespeare 
and for every instance of "The" we record the word that follows "The" 
and add it to a list, known as the <em>successors</em> of "The". Now suppose 
we've done this for every word Shakespeare has used, ever.</p>

<p>Let's go back to "The". Now, we randomly choose a word from this list,
say "cat". Then we look up the successors of "cat" and randomly choose
a word from that list, and we continue this process. This eventually
will terminate in a period (".") and we will have generated a
Shakespearean sentence!</p>

<p>The object that we'll be looking things up in is called a "successor
table", although really it's just a dictionary. The keys in this
dictionary are words, and the values are lists of successors to those
words.</p>

<h3 class="question" id="q1">Question 1</h3>

<p>Here's an incomplete definition of the <code>build_successors_table</code>
function. The input is a list of words (corresponding to a
Shakespearean text), and the output is a successors table. (By
default, the first word is a successor to "."). See the example below:</p>

<pre><code>def build_successors_table(tokens):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Return a dictionary: keys are words; values are lists of
    successors.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; text = [&#x27;We&#x27;, &#x27;came&#x27;, &#x27;to&#x27;, &#x27;investigate&#x27;, &#x27;,&#x27;, &#x27;catch&#x27;, \
                &#x27;bad&#x27;, &#x27;guys&#x27;, &#x27;and&#x27;, &#x27;to&#x27;, &#x27;eat&#x27;, &#x27;pie&#x27;, &#x27;.&#x27;]
    &gt;&gt;&gt; table = build_successors_table(text)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; expected = {&#x27;and&#x27;: [&#x27;to&#x27;], &#x27;We&#x27;: [&#x27;came&#x27;], &#x27;bad&#x27;: [&#x27;guys&#x27;], \
                &#x27;pie&#x27;: [&#x27;.&#x27;], &#x27;,&#x27;: [&#x27;catch&#x27;], &#x27;.&#x27;: [&#x27;We&#x27;], \
                &#x27;to&#x27;: [&#x27;investigate&#x27;, &#x27;eat&#x27;], &#x27;investigate&#x27;: [&#x27;,&#x27;], \
                &#x27;catch&#x27;: [&#x27;bad&#x27;], &#x27;guys&#x27;: [&#x27;and&#x27;], &#x27;eat&#x27;: [&#x27;pie&#x27;], \
                &#x27;came&#x27;: [&#x27;to&#x27;]}
    &gt;&gt;&gt; expected == table
    True
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    table = {}
    prev = &#x27;.&#x27;
    for word in tokens:
        if prev in table:
            "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
        else:
            "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

        prev = word
    return table</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q2">Question 2</h3>

<p>Let's generate some sentences! Suppose we're given a starting word. We
can look up this word in our table to find its list of successors, and
then randomly select a word from this list to be the next word in the
sentence. Then we just repeat until we reach some ending punctuation.</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: to randomly select from a list, first make sure you import the
Python random library with <code>import random</code> and then use the expression
<code>random.choice(my_list)</code>)</p>

<p>This might not be a bad time to play around with adding strings
together as well. Let's fill in the <code>construct_sent</code> function!</p>

<pre><code>def construct_sent(word, table):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Returns a random sentence starting with word, sampling from
    table.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    import random
    result = &#x27; &#x27;
    while word not in [&#x27;.&#x27;, &#x27;!&#x27;, &#x27;?&#x27;]:
        "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
    return result + word</code></pre>

<p>Great! Now all that's left is to run our functions with some actual
code. The following snippet included in the skeleton code will return
a list containing the words in all of the works of Shakespeare.</p>

<p><em>Warning</em>: do <strong>NOT</strong> try to print the return result of this function):</p>

<pre><code>def shakespeare_tokens(path = &#x27;shakespeare.txt&#x27;, url = &#x27;http://goo.gl/SztLfX&#x27;):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Return the words of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays as a list.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    import os
    from urllib.request import urlopen
    if os.path.exists(path):
        return open(&#x27;shakespeare.txt&#x27;, encoding=&#x27;ascii&#x27;).read().split()
    else:
        shakespeare = urlopen(url)
        return shakespeare.read().decode(encoding=&#x27;ascii&#x27;).split()</code></pre>

<p>Next, we probably want an easy way to refer to our list of tokens and
our successors table.  Let's make the following assignments:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tokens = shakespeare_tokens()
&gt;&gt;&gt; table = build_successors_table(tokens)</code></pre>

<p>Finally, let's define an easy to call utility function:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def sent():
        return construct_sent(&#x27;The&#x27;, table)

&gt;&gt;&gt; sent()
&#x27; The plebeians have done us must be news&#x2d;cramm&#x27;d &#x27;

&gt;&gt;&gt; sent()
&#x27; The ravish&#x27;d thee , with the mercy of beauty &#x27;

&gt;&gt;&gt; sent()
&#x27; The bird of Tunis , or two white and plucker down with better ; that&#x27;s God&#x27;s sake &#x27;</code></pre>

<p>Now, if we want to start the sentence with a random word, we can use
the folowing:</p>

<pre><code>def random_sent():
    import random
    return construct_sent(random.choice(table[&#x27;.&#x27;]), table)

&gt;&gt;&gt; random_sent()
&#x27; You have our thoughts to blame his next to be praised and think ?&#x27;

&gt;&gt;&gt; random_sent()
&#x27; Long live by thy name , then , Dost thou more angel , good Master Deep&#x2d;vow , And tak&#x27;st more ado but following her , my sight Of speaking false !&#x27;

&gt;&gt;&gt; random_sent()
&#x27; Yes , why blame him , as is as I shall find a case , That plays at the public weal or the ghost .&#x27;</code></pre>


<h2 id="creating-a-cypher-optional">Creating a Cypher (Optional)</h2>

<p>In this section, we'll be making our own message encryptor using a technique
called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad">one-time pad</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, this technique works by randomly generating a <em>pad</em> for 
each word in a message. A pad is just a random string of letters the 
same length as the word. For example, a pad for the word <code>&#x27;dog&#x27;</code> might
be the string <code>&#x27;yaz&#x27;</code>.</p>

<p>Then, we create our encryption by adding the letters of the original word 
to our pad, mod 26, then using that as the new value for that letter.</p>

<p>For example, the first letter our word <code>&#x27;dog&#x27;</code> is <em>d</em>, which is the
3rd letter in the alphabet (indexing from 0). The first letter in our
pad <code>&#x27;yaz&#x27;</code> is <em>y</em>, the 24th letter in the alphabet. Therefore, the
first letter in our encryption would be <em>b</em> (<code>24 + 3 = 27 % 26 = 1</code>).</p>

<p>Since decrypting this type of message relies on the pad we randomly generate,
after encrypting our message, we're going to use higher order functions and 
nonlocal to lock our randomly generated pad away.</p>

<p>In the Cypher section of your starter file, you've already been given
the function <code>pad_creator</code>. This function takes in a single word, and
returns a pad for it. See the doctests for further clarification on
the domain and range of <code>pad_creator</code>.</p>

<p>You've also been given the dictionary <code>letter_dict</code>, which contains key-value
pairs of letters of the alphabet with their corresponding index.</p>

<h3 class="question" id="q3">Question 3</h3>

<p>What is a pad? What is it used for? How is it different from our
encrypted word?</p>

<p>How are we encrypting our words? Review the Wikipedia article linked
above if you are still unclear on this process.</p>

<p>Make sure you can answer these questions before moving on.</p>

<h3 class="question" id="q4">Question 4</h3>

<p>The first thing we need to do is to find a way to encrypt a single
word.</p>

<p>Write the function <code>word_mutator</code> which takes in a single word and a pad, 
and returns the encrypted version of that word. You may find <code>letter_dict</code> 
useful for this task. You may also find the value <code>string.ascii_lowercase</code> 
useful. <code>string.ascii_lowercase</code> returns a string of all of the lowercase
ASCII characters in order.</p>

<pre><code>def word_mutator(word, pad):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Returns an encrypted version of word using
    the one&#x2d;time pass techinique.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; word_mutator(&#x27;charms&#x27;, &#x27;secret&#x27;)
    &#x27;ulciql&#x27;
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    new_word = &#x27;&#x27;
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q5">Question 5</h3>

<p>Switching gears briefly for this problem, we need to consider the
security of our pad. We can only decrypt our original message if we
have the pad that encrypted it. However, we don't just want to return
the pad with our encrypted message. Instead, lets create a higher
order function <code>make_lock</code>.</p>

<p><code>make_lock</code> takes in the pad we want to secure, a password, and a
number of guesses which defaults to 3. <code>make_lock</code> returns a function
which takes in a password attempt.</p>

<p>If the password is not the same as what was given to <code>make_lock</code>, we
want to reduce the number of guesses left by 1, and store that
attempted guess away. If a password is attempted more than once, or
the amount of guess attempts left reduces to zero, the pad should be
locked away forever.</p>

<p>However, if one gives the correct password before the guess attempts
hits zero, the lock should return the pad given to <code>make_lock</code>, and
then never return the pad again.</p>

<p>Make sure you read and understand the doctests for <code>make_lock</code> before
you start writing your code.</p>

<pre><code>def make_lock(pad, password, n=3):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Returns a function which takes in password attempts.
    If more than n passwords are attempted, then the pad is 
    locked away forever.

    If the same password is attempted more than one, the pad 
    is locked away forever.

    If the password is correct, the pad is returned, and can 
    never be retrieved again from this lock.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; lock1 = make_lock(&#x27;correcthorsebatterystaple&#x27;, &#x27;letmein&#x27;)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; lock1(&#x27;bad password&#x27;)
    &#x27;Sorry, wrong password. Try again?&#x27;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; lock1(&#x27;123456&#x27;)
    &#x27;Sorry, wrong password. Try again?&#x27;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; lock1(&#x27;letmein&#x27;)
    &#x27;correcthorsebatterystaple&#x27;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; lock1(&#x27;letmein&#x27;)
    &#x27;Out of password attempts!&#x27;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; lock2 = make_lock(&#x27;xyzzy&#x27;, &#x27;worst. password. ever.&#x27;)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; lock2(&#x27;Pikachu&#x27;)
    &#x27;Sorry, wrong password. Try again?&#x27;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; lock2(&#x27;Pikachu&#x27;)
    &#x27;Password attempt repeated: security system locked!&#x27;
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    attempts = []
    def lock(attempt):
        "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
    return lock</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q6">Question 6</h3>
Now we can finally write our encryption function!

<p>Write the function <code>OTP_encrypter</code>, which takes in a list of words to
encrypt, and a password to lock the corresponding pad
with. <code>OTP_encrypter</code> should encrypt the <em>original</em> list of words, and
mutate the <code>message</code> to store the encrypted words in it.  It should
return a lock for the pad corresponding to the message.  In order to
recover the list of words, we would have to use the password to
recover the pad (which would be a list of strings, one for each
word).</p>

<pre><code>def OTP_encrypter(message, password):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Encrypts the words in the orignial list message, and
    returns a lock for the pad generated using password.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; message = [&#x27;robbery&#x27;, &#x27;planned&#x27;, &#x27;on&#x27;, &#x27;monday&#x27;]
    &gt;&gt;&gt; message_copy = message[:]
    &gt;&gt;&gt; lock = OTP_encrypter(message, &#x27;open sesame&#x27;)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; message == message_copy
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; lock(&#x27;open please?&#x27;)
    &#x27;Sorry, wrong password. Try again?&#x27;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; pad = lock(&#x27;open sesame&#x27;)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; assert type(pad) == list
    &gt;&gt;&gt; assert len(pad) == len(message)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; assert len(message) == len(message_copy)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(len(message)):
    ...     assert word_mutator(message_copy[i], pad[i]) == message[i]
    ...
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    pad = []
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"</code></pre>

<p>Congratuations! You've made your very own cryptography program.</p>
