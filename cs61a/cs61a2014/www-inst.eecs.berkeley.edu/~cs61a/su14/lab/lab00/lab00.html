<h2 id="submission">Deadline</h2>

<p>By the end of this lab, you should have submitted the <code>lab00</code>
assignment using the command <code>submit lab00</code>.</p>

<p><strong>This lab is due by 11:59pm on 06/25/2014.</strong></p>

<p>Here is a <a href="lab00.py">lab00.py</a> starter file for this lab.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello and welcome to 61A! Before class gets started, we are going to
have you do a preliminary lab to set up your computer. In this lab,
we'll show you how to download Python, write code in a text editor,
and run it on your interpreter so you can complete and submit labs,
homeworks, and projects. In the process, we will walk you through how
to submit your first assignment.</p>


<h2 id="downloading-python">Downloading Python</h2>

<p>The first step is to download Python. If you have a Mac, Python 2
comes pre-installed, but for 61A you'll need Python 3 (either 3.3 or
3.4). You can download <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>. Make sure to choose the correct
operating system (most likely Mac OSX, Windows, or Linux).</p>


<h2 id="finding-a-good-text-editor">Finding a Good Text Editor</h2>

<p>You'll need a text editor to edit code. We've provided some options
below, but if you've gotten comfortable editing code (not regular
text) on some other text editor, feel free to continue using
that. Note that <strong>Microsoft Word, Notepad, and related products are
not good text editors.</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Note: Even though a standard download of Python will come with a
  text editor called Idle, we <strong>do not</strong> recommend it at all. The
  reason is that you won't gain as much experience using the command
  line to run your Python programs. This will hurt you a lot once you
  start working on the projects for this class so we highly recommend
  that you use the command line to run your files from day 1!</p></blockquote>

<p>Most people who are new to programming find Sublime Text to be the
most comfortable first text editor, but you should definitely explore
all the options above to find the one that works for you.</p>


<h2 id="downloading-and-manipulating-files">Downloading and Manipulating Files</h2>

<p>Now that we have a text editor, let's start editing some files! Every
homework assignment, we will provide you with a template with a lot of
starter code already filled in for you. Remember, that assignment we
mentioned at the beginning? You can get the template we just mentioned
for it <a href="../../src/lab00/lab00.py">here</a>!</p>

<p>You should now have a file called <strong><code>lab00.py</code></strong> somewhere on your
computer. Go ahead and open up that file in your text editor of
choice.</p>

<p>For the screenshots that you'll see below, we're using Sublime Text 2
on Mac OS X with the Solarized color scheme. Sublime Text 2 runs the
same on any computer so don't worry if yours looks a little different,
the functionality is identical.</p>

<p>Now before we edit our file, the first thing that you should notice is
the text wrapped in three quotation marks <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;</code> at the beginning of
each function definition. That text is called a <em>docstring</em>, which is
a description of what the function is intended to do. Docstrings are
extremely useful because other programmers can read them to get a nice
description of what the function is supposed to do, without having to
read your code.</p>

<p>Within the docstring, there are lines which begin with<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. That's
the start of a <em>doctest</em>. The first line of a doctest shows the
function being called on a particular input (if the function takes
inputs). The line immediately underneath shows the expected output of
that call. Doctests are a great way both to describe the function in
terms of what it's supposed to do and check that you've written it
correctly. Let's try an example, the <code>my_last_name()</code> function.</p>

<p><img src="assets/my_name.png" alt="my_last_name doctest"></p>

<p>The two tests in our docstring check two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>That you changed the return value from the default <code>&#x27;PUT YOUR LAST
  NAME HERE&#x27;</code></li>
  <li>That the return value is a string and not something else (like a
  number)</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to use these tests to check that we've written our function correctly, we will have to open the Python interpreter on a <em>terminal window</em>. If you are using Mac OSX or Linux, you should have a program called Terminal already installed, and can simply open it up. If you're on Windows, you have a few options:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Mac or Unix</th>
    <th>Windows</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Terminal</td>
    <td><a href="https://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash">GitBash</a> (Runs a Unix like terminal)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><a href="http://cygwin.com/install.html">Cygwin</a> (More advanced version of GitBash)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Once you have your terminal window set up, we're going to learn some
Unix commands - Unix commands are a way to navigate files and folders,
open applications, and much more, all from the Terminal (and without
having to use a mouse).</p>

<p><img src="assets/terminal.png" alt="terminal"></p>

<p>Right now, you should be in your home directory (a directory is simply
a folder on your computer). Don't worry if your terminal doesn't look
exactly the same. The important part is that the text on the left hand
side is relatively similar (with a different name) and there should
definitely be a <code>~</code>. (The <code>~</code> is a shortcut for the home directory).</p>

<p>Now for our commands. The first three commands that we will be
learning are <code>ls</code>, <code>cd</code>, and <code>mkdir</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ls</code> lists all the sub-directories or files in your current directory</li>
  <li><code>cd</code> lets you switch directories (it stands for "change directory")</li>
  <li><code>cd destination_directory_name</code> changes you into a <em>sub-directory</em> named
  <code>destination_directory_name</code> (it will fail if <code>destination_directory_name</code> is not immediately inside the current directory)</li>
  <li><code>cd ..</code> switches you into the parent directory of your current directory</li>
  <li><code>cd</code> jumps you back to the home directory</li>
  <li>To <code>cd</code> into any directory in your computer (not necessarily a
  sub-directory of the current directory), you need to know its entire
  <em>file-path</em>, or all the directories from the home directory to the
  one you want. If I want to find lab00 inside labs inside cs61a
  inside home, for example, I would type <code>cd ~/labs/lab00</code></li>
  <li><code>mkdir</code> creates a new sub-directory in your current directory like
  so: <code>mkdir new_directory_name</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Since it's a good idea to have a folder dedicated to containing all
your materials for this course, let's make a directory called
<code>cs61a</code>. To do this, just type <code>mkdir cs61a</code> and magically, a new
folder called <code>cs61a</code> will be created! We can now <code>cd</code> into this new
folder and add some more folders for organization. Let's add a <code>hw</code>
and a <code>lab</code> folder inside our <code>cs61a</code> directory and then, another
<code>lab00</code> folder inside of the <code>lab</code> folder like so:</p>

<pre><code>stuff ~ $ cd cs61a
stuff cs61a $ mkdir hw
stuff cs61a $ mkdir labs
stuff cs61a $ mkdir labs/lab00</code></pre>

<p>Now if we list the contents of the directory with <code>ls</code>, we can see
that we have the two folders <code>hw</code> and <code>labs</code>.</p>

<p>The next thing we have to do is find our downloaded file. By default,
it's probably in <code>~/Downloads</code> if you're using Mac OS/Linux/Windows
(GitBash or Cygwin) or <code>C:/Users/NAMEOFUSER/Downloads</code>if you're using
the Windows Command Line (cmd.exe). Let's <code>cd</code> into that directory.</p>

<p>Next, we'll use the <code>mv</code> command to move our file into our homework
directory like so:</p>

<pre><code>stuff Downloads $ mv lab00.py ~/cs61a/labs/lab00</code></pre>

<p>This command tells the terminal that we want to move the file located
at <code>~/Downloads/lab00.py</code> to the directory <code>~/cs61a/labs/lab00</code>.</p>

<p>We should change back to our <code>lab00</code> folder now that our file has been
moved there. We're just about ready to start editing!</p>

<pre><code>stuff Downloads $ cd ~/cs61a/labs/lab00</code></pre>

<p>Don't worry if this seems like a lot to take in at the moment, it will
get way easier over time. Just keep practicing!</p>


<h2 id="editing-files-using-a-productive-workflow">Editing Files using a Productive Workflow</h2>

<p>Open up your file which is now located in <code>~/cs61a/labs/lab00</code> in your text
editor of choice and let's begin editing!</p>

<p>We suggest having these two windows open and simultaneously visible at
all times:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your text editor with the files that you're editing</li>
  <li>Your terminal window so you can easily run doctests</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's a screenshot of a typical workspace. We've got our text editor
on the left, and our terminal on the right!</p>

<p><img src="assets/productive_workflow.png" alt="workspace"></p>


<h3 id="doctests">Doctests</h3>

<p>Let's get back to doctests. Again, doctests are a way for us to write simple tests for our
code. We're basically asking ourselves, "What is the expected output
of this function if I put in this specific input?"</p>

<p>To run our doctests, we type this command in our terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 &#x2d;m doctest lab00.py</code></pre>

<p>This will give us a lot of output that shows which tests we are
currently failing. Try running it on the file you just downloaded. You
should see something like this:</p>

<p><img src="assets/doctest_output.png" alt="Doctest with 6 failures"></p>

<p>Since we haven't edited the template at all yet, we're not too surprised that the doctests failed. But let's take this opportunity to analyze the failure messages. Take a look at the <code>my_last_name</code> test, highlighted here:</p>

<p><img src="assets/my_name_test_failure.png" alt="my_last_name failure"></p>

<p>This output gives us some pretty good debugging info. For
this particular test, it's saying we have an error in our <code>lab00.py</code>
file on line 12 in the function <code>my_last_name</code>. Now we know where to
look to fix the error (now is a good time to make sure your text
editor displays line numbers). After we find the line, let's
understand why we failed this test. The test expected that when the
<code>my_last_name</code> function is called with no inputs, it should <strong>not</strong>
return the string <code>&#x27;PUT YOUR LAST NAME HERE&#x27;</code>. Change that line to
return your actual last name. Make sure you enter this information
carefully because this is how we will associate all homework,
projects, and exams with you and your account.</p>

<p>Once you have changed the return value of the function <code>my_last_name</code>
(make sure that you are returning a string, which has quotes around
it), you should be able to run the doctests again and your test for
<code>my_last_name</code> should pass, leaving only five failures to fix.</p>

<p><strong>Other notes about doctests:</strong> You might run your doctests and see
  that there is no output.  This is good! Doctests will only print
  output when you have failures in your tests. However, if you want to
  be super sure that you're passing all of the tests, you can add a
  command flag <code>&#x2d;v</code> to the command to see the <code>verbose</code> output:</p>

<pre><code>python3 &#x2d;m doctest &#x2d;v lab00.py</code></pre>

<p>For the section number, you can find a complete list of all the
sections on the class calendar which is located
<a href="../../index.html#schedule">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have successfully completed the homework and have 0 tests
failing, the verbose output of the doctests should look something like
this:</p>

<p><img src="assets/successful_doctests.png" alt="verbose doctests with 0 failures"></p>


<h2 id="logging-in-to-the-instructional-server">Logging in to the Instructional Server</h2>

<p>Before you can submit, you'll want to log in to the instructional
server using the login and default password provided on the sheet
which should have been passed out in the beginning of lab.</p>


<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>

<p>For Windows, you'll be using a program called
<a href="http://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a>. See
<a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa10/fromhome.pdf">this</a>
guide on how to set it up.  Note that instead of
<code>h50.cs.berkeley.edu</code>, you should use <code>cory.eecs.berkeley.edu</code>.</p>


<h3 id="mac-linux">Mac/Linux</h3>

<p>You'll be using a command on your terminal called <code>ssh</code> to log in to
the instructional accounts.<code>ssh</code> stands for "secure shell" - a shell
is a way to access an operating system (your terminal is a type of
shell), so <code>ssh</code> allows you to securely access a remote operating
system. The format is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>ssh cs61a&#x2d;??@cory.eecs.berkeley.edu</code></pre>

<p>When you type it in, replace <code>??</code> with your CS 61A login (found on the
login sheet passed out at the beginning of lab). You'll be prompted
for your password (the one given on the login sheet). Once you enter
it, you're logged in as your username on the <code>cory</code> server at
<code>eecs.berkeley.edu</code>.</p>


<h3 id="registering-and-changing-your-password">Registering and Changing Your Password</h3>

<p>Once logged in, you'll see something like this:</p>

<p><img src="assets/inst_login.png" alt="login screen"></p>

<p>The first thing you want to do is register. To get started, simply
enter the command <code>register</code> and you'll be prompted for information
such as your name, email, SID, etc. <strong>Please answer all of those
questions accurately - it is how we determine your identity for the
purposes of grading.</strong> Once you're done, use the command
<code>check&#x2d;register</code> to make sure all your information is correct.</p>

<p>The next thing you'll want to do is replace the annoying default
password we provided you with something more memorable. For that, type
in the command <code>ssh update</code>. You should be taken to a menu bar which
is currently set on "Change Password". Hit enter and change your
password settings, then exit.</p>


<h3 id="copying-files-to-the-server">Copying Files to the Server</h3>

<p>Now that you have finished the lab and your registration, it's time
to copy the lab file to the instructional server.</p>


<h4 id="windows">Windows</h4>

<p>For Windows, you'll need to download a program called
<a href="http://winscp.net/eng/download.php">WinSCP</a> in order to copy files. After you've installed WinSCP, you'll have to configure it so that you
can log in to the server. Here's a screenshot of a typical log in:</p>

<p><img src="assets/WinSCP.png" alt="winscp configuration"></p>

<p>Once you're logged in, all you have to do is navigate to your
<code>~/cs61a/labs/lab00</code> folder on the left and drag your file over to the server
on the right.</p>


<h4 id="mac-linux">Mac/Linux</h4>

<p>Mac and Linux users can use the built-in terminal you've used to log in to the server.</p>

<p>First, open a new terminal window (without closing the terminal window you used to log in). Navigate to the directory which contains your <code>lab00</code> file. Then type in the following command:</p>

<pre><code>stuff lab00 $ scp lab00.py cs61a&#x2d;??@cory.eecs.berkeley.edu:~/</code></pre>

<p>Again, replace <code>??</code> with your login. Here <code>scp</code> stands for "secure
copy" - you are telling the computer to securely copy the file
<code>lab00.py</code> from the <code>lab00</code> directory on your home computer to your
account on the instructional server.</p>

<p>The text that comes after the colon is important. We're specifying
where on the server we want the file to go. In this case, we're
placing it in the server's home directory, again represented by the
<code>~</code> symbol. If you later add folders on the server, you could specify
a destination like <code>cs61a&#x2d;??@cory.eecs.berkeley.edu:~/labs/lab00</code>.</p>

<p>After typing this command, you'll be asked for your password and the
the file will transfer over - now we can go on to submitting.</p>


<h2 id="submitting-your-homework-and-projects">Submitting your Homework and Projects</h2>

<p>Now that you have all of your files for your assignment on the
instructional servers, we can submit the assignment.</p>

<p>Switch back into the window where you are logged in to the instructional server. You should be able to use <code>ls</code> to see the file you just copied over.</p>

<p>We're going to first create a folder for our <code>lab00.py</code> file. In the
future, you'll be submitting projects with multiple files so it's good
to get in the habit of creating a new folder for each
assignment. Let's make the new <code>lab00</code> directory, move our <code>lab00.py</code> into
it, and then change into our <code>lab00</code> folder:</p>

<pre><code>stuff ~ # mkdir lab00
stuff ~ # mv lab00.py lab00
stuff ~ # cd lab00
stuff ~/lab00 #</code></pre>

<p>To submit the lab, use the command</p>

<pre><code>stuff ~/lab00 # submit lab00</code></pre>

<p>Answer the questions that come up by typing <code>yes</code> or <code>no</code>. Once that's
done, you can check that you sucessfully submitted with:</p>

<pre><code>stuff ~/lab00 # glookup &#x2d;t</code></pre>

<p><code>glookup</code> is the name of the command that you will use this semester
to check your grades. At any time, you can simply enter <code>glookup</code> to
check for the grades of your submitted assignments (the ones that have
been graded so far). Adding a <code>&#x2d;t</code> to the <code>glookup</code> command allows you
to see all the times that you have successfully submitted a homework
or project. You should see a successful submission of about 1 minute
ago.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You've just submitted your first assignment!</p>
