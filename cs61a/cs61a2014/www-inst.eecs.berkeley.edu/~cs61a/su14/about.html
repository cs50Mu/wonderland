<h2 class="header">61A Course Information and Policies</h2>

<p>
Course website:
<a href="index.html">

</a>

<h3 class="section" id="course-description">Course Description</h3>

<p>The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular
emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view. This
first course concentrates mostly on the idea of abstraction, allowing the
programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level
operations dictated by the computer hardware. The next course, CS 61B, will deal
with the more advanced engineering aspects of software, such as constructing and
analyzing large programs. Finally, CS 61C concentrates on machines and how they
carry out the programs you write.</p>

<p>In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how
to use one particular programming language. We consider a series of techniques
for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data
abstraction, and object-oriented programming. Mastery of a particular
programming language is a very useful side effect of studying these general
techniques. However, our hope is that once you have learned the essence of
programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a
few days' work.</p>

<p>There is also a self-paced version of this course,
<a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su14/61as.html">61AS</a>,
which fulfills the same requirements.

</p><h3 class="section" id ="programming-language">Programming Language</h3>

<p>61A uses the Python 3 programming language. Python is a popular language in
both industry and academia. It is also particularly well-suited to the task of
exploring the topics taught in this course. It is an open-source language
developed by a large volunteer community that prides itself on the diversity of
its contributors. </p>

<p>In previous semesters, this course was taught using the Scheme language, a
dialect of Lisp, which is the oldest programming language that is still
recruiting new users today. Lisp and Python are similar in many ways. In fact,
Lisp popularized many of the features that make Python a great language. Our
choice to change languages is primarily motivated by the strength of Python's
programming community, which you will soon join as you learn the language.
Python also has excellent library support for a vast range of application areas.
Knowing Python will help you pursue your future programming interests, wherever
they may lead you.</p>


<h3 class="section" id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Math 1A is a corequisite for 61A. (That is, it may be taken
concurrently.)</p>

<p>There is no formal programming-related prerequisites for admission to 61A.
However, most 61A students have had significant prior programming experience.
There is no need for you to be familiar with any particular programming
language. If you have taken the CS Advanced Placement AB course in C++ or Java,
you are certainly ready for 61A.</p>

<p>If you don't feel ready for 61A, There is
<a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs10/">CS 10 : The Beauty and Joy of Computing</a>,
which is an introduction to computer science for non-majors (and majors needing
more programming experience). The course will teach students how to program
using BYOB (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages
ever invented. It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply
dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But
the course is far more than just learning to program! You'll learn some of the
"Big Ideas" of computing, such as abstraction, design, recursion, concurrency,
simulations, and the limits of computation. You'll also see some beautiful
applications of computing that have changed the world, as well as talk about
the history of computing and where it will go in the future.</p>

<p><strong>However, if you have no previous programming experience, We strongly
    recomend you try CS 61A out anyways. Many 61A students who started with
    zero programming experience have gone on to become accomplished
    programmers/Computer Scientists after taking 61A. Summer 61A especially has
    many avenues of support designed to help you succeed, all you need to do is
    ask.</strong></p>

<p>If you have substantial prior programming background, you may feel that you
can skip 61A. In most cases we don't recommend that. Although 61A is the first
course in the CS sequence, it's quite different from most introductory courses.
You won't be bored in 61A. Perhaps your prior experience will allow you to skip
61B or 61C, which are more comparable to courses taught elsewhere.


</p><h3 class="section" id="course-materials">Course Materials</h3>

<p>There is no required textbook for this course. Our primary text will be a
series of lecture notes based on the classic book, <a
    href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">Structure and
    Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>, which has been the textbook for
61A for many years. Lecture notes will be posted to the course website. </p>


<h3 class="section" id="lab-and-discussion-sections">Lab and Discussion Sections</h3>

<p>In addition to the lectures Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, the
course consists of two discussion sections and two laboratory sections each
week.</p>

<p>The discussion sections are run by an amazing group of Teaching Assistants.
This course is currently full, so please attend your assigned section. You can
try to switch to a different lecture or section by posting on the appropriate
thread on <a href="https://piazza.com/berkeley/summer2014/cs61a/home">Piazza</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure that you are in a definite section by next week.
    Projects 3 and 4 will be done in pairs. We strongly encourage you
    to find a partner in your own section early on with whom you can
    study and do projects 3 and 4. Your TA will help you.</p>

<p>You are expected to attend all class meetings, including lectures, sections,
and labs.</p>

<p><strong>Enrollment:</strong> Your TA does not have any power over enrollment
whatsoever. Admission to the class is controlled by the EECS department.</p>


<h3 class="section" id="computer-accounts">Computer Accounts</h3>

<p><em>You must</em> have a computer account on the 61A course facility. To set up
an account, you need an account form, which you will receive in the first lab.

</p><p>You must set up your account in the first week because that is how we know
who is really in the class. If you are pre-enrolled but do not set up your
account this week, you may be dropped from the course! Account forms will be
distributed in lab and office hours this week. The first time you log in, you
will be asked to type in your name and reg card number, if you have one.
<em>Please follow the instructions carefully.</em> You must get your account and
log into during your first lab so that we have an accurate class count.

</p><p>If you plan to use your personal computer for the course projects, you must
get a class account, even if you intend never to use it. Class accounts are
required for submitting assignments.

</p><p>If you are not pre-enrolled and want to take 61A, you have to add the course
using Tele-BEARS. If you are something other than a regular Berkeley
undergraduate, then you probably need a signature on a form admitting you to the
course: contact the instructors directly.

</p><h3 class="section" id="ask-questions">Ask Questions!</h3>

<p>Your first and most important resource for help in learning the material in
this course is your fellow students. Work closely with your project partner. You
are responsible for helping each other learn.</p>

<p>A good non-person resource to consult is our <a
    href="http://ocf.berkeley.edu/~shidi/cs61a/w" target="_blank">Wiki</a>,
which strives to be THE reference for everything 61A.</p>

<p><strong>If your question is quick, or you don't know where to look for help,
    please check out the #general channel on our IRC server: 107.170.82.182. To
    connect, you'll need an IRC client. We have a web based client specifically
    for 61A <a href="http://chat.cs61a.org/"
        target="_blank">here</a></strong>.<p>

<p>If you have questions that others might have as well, regarding
projects, homeworks, course policies, etc., post your questions to <a
    href="https://piazza.com/berkeley/summer2014/cs61a/home">Piazza</a>, the course messaging
service. Piazza allows you to answer questions from other students, which is
one of the best ways to learn the material.

</p><p>The class will have a staff of undergraduate Lab Assistants (LAs). Each
LA will have scheduled hours to be in the lab. Whenever an LA is in the lab you
may request that s/he answer questions about the homework or programs (but not
do them for you).

</p><p>The instructors and the Teaching Assistants who teach the discussion sections
are also available to answer questions. You may drop in during office hours, make
appointments for other times, or email us.


</p><h3 class="section" id="computer-resources">Computer Resources</h3>

<p>The computing laboratories in 271, 273, and 275 Soda are our primary lab
rooms, although the CS 61A accounts can also be used from any EECS Instructional
lab in Soda or Cory Hall. The lab is normally available for use at all times,
but you need a card key for evening access to the lab.

</p><p><b>Current UCB students:</b> If you are enrolled in the course, your Cal
student ID serves as your card key and will automatically be activated for
access to the Soda second floor labs (including entering the building). You do
not have to do anything, unless for some reason it doesn't work, then see below.

</p><p><b>Concurrent/other students</b>: You can fill out an application and obtain a
white card key from 387 Soda Hall (the front desk). There is a small fee for
access.

</p><p>During scheduled lab sessions, only students enrolled in that particular
section may be in the lab. At other hours, any 61A student may use the lab on a
drop-in basis. (The labs on the second floor of Soda Hall are unlocked during
daytime hours.)

</p><p>Be respectful of the lab space. Please don't steal the chairs, or bring in
food or drinks. Don't unplug anything; unplugged computers make our hard-working
instructional computing team very sad. Don't monopolize a workstation for six
hours during prime time to play games. If you see someone disrupting the space,
ask them to stop.


</p><p>The first lab requires you to work on the computer; part of the
    purpose of the assignment is to ensure that you know how to
    create, edit, and print files. Pick up your computer account this
    week, whether or not you are pre-enrolled.


</p><h3 class="section" id="projects-and-homeworks">Projects and Homeworks</h3>

<p>Each week there will be problems assigned for you to work on, most of which will
involve writing and debugging programs. These assignments come in three categories:

</p><ul>
  <li><b>Laboratory exercises</b> are short, relatively simple exercises
  designed to introduce a new topic. You'll do these during the scheduled lab
  meetings. You will turn these in at the end of your lab section.

  </li>
  <li><b>Homework assignments</b> are slightly more involved
  versions of lab exercises, meant to illustrate and explore new
  topics. There are usually two homeworks per week that will be due
  on Wednesdays and Saturdays at 11:59:59pm. You are encouraged to
  discuss the homework with other students, but your final solution
  should be developed alone.

  </li>
  <li><b>Projects</b> are larger assignments intended to teach you how to
  combine ideas from the course in interesting ways. There are four
  projects during the semester. The first two projects should be
  completed individually. You should complete projects 3 and 4 in
  pairs; your partner should be another student in your section.
</li></ul>

<p>The purpose of the lab is for you to learn the course material with
  the guidance of the teaching staff.  The lab represents a baseline
  level of competence with the material that we expect everyone to
  achieve with the help of the staff. So, the labs are graded on the
  correctness of your solutions.

</p><p>Each lab is worth one point for a correct solution and zero points
    for a missing or incorrect solution.

</p><p>The purpose of the homework is for you to learn the course material, not to
prove that you already know it. Therefore, the weekly homeworks are not graded
on the correctness of your solutions, but on effort. You will get full credit
for an entirely wrong answer that shows reasonable effort! Homeworks will be
graded automatically.

</p><p>Each homework is worth two points for a reasonable effort, zero points for a
missing homework or one that seems to show no effort, or negative ten (-10)
points for a solution copied from someone else.

</p><p>The four programming projects are graded on the correctness and
    clarity of your solutions. For Projects 3 and 4, you and your
    partner should work together to ensure that both group members
    understand the complete program you create.

</p><p>Projects and homeworks will be submitted online. Through a web-based code
review system, you will receive detailed feedback on your projects.


</p><h3 class="section" id="tests-and-grading">Tests and Grading</h3>

<p>Your course grade is computed using a point system with a total of 314
points, with the following distribution.

</p><ul>
  <li>Two midterms, each worth 50 points.
  </li><li>One final exam, worth 80 points.
  </li><li>Four projects, worth a total of 90 points
  </li><li>Fourteen homeworks, worth a total of 28 points
  </li><li>Sixteen labs, worth a total of 16 points
</li></ul>

<p>Exams are held in the evenings to give you more time to
  complete them than lecture would allow.  You are allowed to bring one
  double-sided 8.5 in. by 11 in. cheat sheet to the first midterm, two
  sheets to the second midterm, and three sheets to the final.  These
  cheat sheets may be handwritten or typed.  We recommend that you
  reuse your cheat sheets.
<!--</p><p>Midterms are held in the evenings from 7pm-9pm to give you more time to
complete them than lecture would allow. You will be allowed to bring a fixed
number of pages of notes to each exam. Details of this policy will be released
as the exam approaches.-->

</p><p><b>Midterms will be held on Thursday 7/10 and 7/31</b>!  The
    times are not yet finalized (we have requested either 5 to 7pm or
    7 to 9pm). If you are not available on these days, notify your TA
    immediately.

</p><p>Each letter grade for the course corresponds to a range of
    scores:

</p><pre>
A+  304+        A  291-303     A-  284-290
B+  265-283     B  248-264     B-  231-247
C+  224-230     C  217-223     C-  209-216
D+  199-208     D  188-198     D-  178-187
</pre>

<p>Notice that this scale is nonlinear; the steps are wider in the B range.

</p><p>This grading formula implies that <i>there is no curve</i>; your grade
will depend only on how well you do, and not on how well everyone else
does.

</p><p>Incomplete grades will be granted only for dire medical or personal
emergencies that cause you to miss the final, and only if your work up to
that point has been satisfactory.

<a name="recover"></a> </p><p><b>Midterm Recovery Policy</b>
On the final exam, you can earn back a fraction of the points you
lost on the midterms. If X is the sum of your midterm 1 and midterm 2 scores,
you will earn back up to 75% of max(0, 60-X). The fraction you earn back is
based on your final score Y and is computed as min(45, Y-20)/60.

</p><p>For example, if the sum of your midterm scores is 30/100 and your final score
is 40/80, then you earn back 20/60=33.3% of 60-30=30 points, giving you an extra
10 points. Assuming a full score on projects and homework (e.g., 120/120 non-
exam points), you will earn a C-.


</p><h3 class="section" id="learning-cooperatively">Learning Cooperatively</h3>

<p>With the obvious exception of exams, we encourage you to discuss <i>all</i>
of the course activities with your friends and classmates as you are working on
them. You will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than
if you do not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.

</p><p>Since you're working collaboratively, keep your project partner and TA
informed. If some medical or personal emergency takes you away from the course
for an extended period, or if you decide to drop the course for any reason,
please don't just disappear silently!  You should inform your project partner
and your TA, so that nobody is depending on you to do something you can't
finish.


</p><h3 class="section" id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>

<p>Cooperation has a limit, however, and in 61A that limit is code. Homework
problems should be completed and turned in individually. Feel free to discuss
the problems with others beforehand; just submit your own work in the end. This
applies also to Projects 1 and 2.</p>

<p>To be clear, the following unfun and uncool activities will be considered cheating:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Using another student's code on a solo assignment</li>
    <li>Using code from a student who is not your partner on a partner assignment</li>
    <li>Using code from previous students or from an online source</li>
    <li>Sharing your code with other students or posting your code online</li>
    <li><strong>Failing to report any of the above</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This list is <em>not</em> comprehensive: the instructors reserve the right
to go beyond this list at any time in the face of actions that violate the
spirit of the course.</p>

<p>Projects 3 and 4 are to be completed in pairs, which means you may share
code with one partner. You <em>should not</em> be sharing lines of code with
others or reading code from other people's projects. Write your own programs
and keep them to yourself.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that even <em>looking</em> at another student's code
  could be considered cheating.  It is very easy to look at another
  student's solution to "get the idea", but then come up with almost
  exactly the same code, which would be considered cheating.</p>

<p>We expect you to hand in your own work, take your own tests, and complete your
own projects. The assignments and evaluations are structured to help you learn,
which is why you're in College. The course staff works hard to put together this
course, and we ask in return that you respect the integrity of the course by not
misrepresenting your work.

</p><p>The EECS Department Policy on Academic Dishonesty says, "Copying all or part
of another person's work, or using reference materials not specifically allowed,
are forms of cheating and will not be tolerated." The policy statement goes on
to explain the penalties for cheating, which range from a zero grade for the
test up to dismissal from the University, for a second offense.

<p><strong>If you are found to be cheating in this course, we will always ask
    you to come in and discuss the situation and give you a chance to explain.
    The first offense results in a negative score for the assignment. If you
    are found to be cheating a second time, we will not hesitate to fail you,
    report you to the center for student conduct, and then also call your
    parents.</strong></p>

</p><p>Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in
this course!  The TAs, lab assistants, and instructor are all here to help you
succeed. If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the
projects, you won't need to copy any answers.


</p><h3 class="section" id="late-policy">Late Policy</h3>

<p>If you cannot turn in an assignment on time, contact your TA and partner as
early as possible. Late project submission requires approval by your
TA. Typically, projects will be accepted up to 24 hours after the deadline, but
late projects will only receive 2/3 of the earned score. No credit will be given
for late homework, or for projects turned in more than one day late. Exceptions
may be made for <em>extraordinary</em> circumstances.


</p><h3 class="section" id="a-parting-thought">A Parting Thought</h3>

<p>This document shouldn't end with a list of late penalties, because penalties
and grades aren't the purpose of the course. We actually just want you to learn.
We're very excited to have such a large and enthusiastic group of students this
semester. We want all of you to be successful here. Welcome to 61A. :)
